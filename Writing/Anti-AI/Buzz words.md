The influence of the flow regime on the performance of Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysers (PEMWEs) is explained by two conflicting models found in the literature. Specifically, regarding concentration overpotential, these models offer different perspectives on how the hydrodynamics inside the flow channels affect the system's electrochemical efficiency. The first model suggests that the electrolyzer's performance declines when gas slugs grow inside the flow channels [63]. From this perspective, the formation of these slugs blocks the flow channels, preventing liquid water from reaching the liquid-gas diffusion layer (LGDL) and, consequently, the active catalyst sites where the oxygen evolution reaction occurs. This restriction in mass transfer of the reactant (water) leads to an increase in concentration overpotential, which results in a drop in overall cell performance. At high current densities, where the rate of gas evolution increases significantly, this phenomenon becomes especially critical [63].

On the other hand, the second model suggests that performance could be improved by the gas bubbles in the flow channels. From this perspective, turbulence in the flow is caused by bubbles, particularly larger ones [64]. Smaller bubbles on the surface of the LGDL are believed to detach under the influence of this localized turbulence. By effectively removing these bubbles from the porous transport medium, water ingress is enhanced, and product gases from the catalyst layer can escape more easily. This process is proposed to reduce concentration overpotential by speeding up the mass transfer of both reactants and products, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the PEMWE.

Restructuring and Content Condensing

**Streamline the Literature Review:** The literature review is quite comprehensive. While thorough, some sections could be summarized. For instance, the detailed breakdown of different MEA fabrication methods (Figure 3) could be condensed into a single paragraph explaining the superiority of the CCM approach for your study's purposes. Similarly, the lengthy discussion on various flow field designs could be shortened to focus only on the design you used and why.

- **Chapter 2 (Literature Review):**
    
    - Condense the "Hydrogen Economy and Global Policies" section. The core message is the push for green hydrogen and the associated economic challenges. This can be stated more briefly.
        
    - Shorten the "PEM Electrolyzer Design Background" section. The level of detail on material science (e.g., the molecular structures in Figure 5) might be more than what's necessary for the main body of a techno-economic analysis.

Methodology
**Chapter 3 (Materials and Methods):**

- As mentioned, move the detailed mathematical derivations to an appendix.
    
- The "Process Description" (3.2.2) provides a good overview, but some of the finer details about the plant's components could be summarized

**Consolidate Results and Discussion:** The "Results and Discussion" chapter (Chapter 4) could be made more concise by integrating the interpretation of the results more directly with their presentation. For example, instead of describing a figure and then explaining its implications in a separate paragraph, you could combine these into a more integrated narrative.

**Chapter 5 (Conclusion):**

- The "Future Research Directions" section (5.5) is quite extensive. While valuable, you could summarize these future plans more concisely. For example, the detailed description of the multi-objective optimization workflow could be presented as a brief overview of the next research steps


üñºÔ∏è Visuals and Formatting

Adjusting the layout of your figures and tables can also save a significant amount of space.

- **Combine and Shrink Figures:** Some figures can be combined or made smaller. For example, the four graphs in Figure 15, which show the sensitivity of cell performance to different parameters, could be combined into a single, more compact figure with a 2x2 grid layout.

**Reformat Tables:** The tables in the appendices, such as the list of PEM Electrolyzer Cell Design Parameters, could be formatted more compactly to take up less vertical space
**Adjust Margins and Spacing:** While you need to adhere to your university's formatting guidelines, you might have some flexibility with margins and line spacing. A small reduction in margin size or a slight decrease in line spacing can add up to several saved pages over the entire document.


### Revised Literature Review (Target: 10 Pages)

#### **1. Introduction and Motivation (Merge of Chapter 1 and Section 2.1)**

- **Combine Problem Statement and Policy Context**: Start with a unified introduction that establishes the core problem: the high cost of green hydrogen compared to fossil-fuel-derived alternatives1.
    
- **Streamline Policy Discussion**: Briefly mention key global and U.S. policies like the REPowerEU plan and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)2222, but avoid going into excessive detail. The key takeaway is that while incentives exist, fundamental cost reduction is necessary3.
    
- **Focus on PEM Technology**: Transition directly to why PEM electrolysis is a promising but expensive technology, highlighting its high efficiency and compact footprint4. This sets the stage for the rest of the review.
    

---

#### **2. PEM Electrolyzer Fundamentals (Condensed Section 2.2)**

- **Simplify the MEA and Cell Structure**:
    
    - Reduce the discussion on MEA fabrication methods (CCM vs. PTE/DMD) 555555555 to a single paragraph. State that your study uses the Catalyst-Coated Membrane (CCM) approach due to its superior performance and durability6, and move on.
        
    - Figure 3 can be removed to save space.
        
- **Condense Material Science Details**:
    
    - For the Proton Exchange Membrane (Section 2.2.2), focus on the trade-offs of PFSA (Nafion) membranes‚Äîgood performance but high cost and hydrogen crossover7. Briefly mention hydrocarbon-based membranes as a promising alternative without excessive detail8. Figure 5, showing molecular structures, is not essential and can be removed.
        
    - For Electrocatalysts (Section 2.2.3), state that Iridium oxide (
        
        IrO2‚Äã) for the anode and Platinum (Pt) for the cathode are the state-of-the-art materials9999. Acknowledge the high cost and scarcity of Iridium as a key challenge10101010. The detailed history of catalyst research can be significantly shortened.
        
    - Figure 4, which details material candidates, can be simplified or removed. A simple sentence listing the key materials would suffice.
        
- **Streamline Flow Field and Degradation Discussion**:
    
    - **Flow Field Design (Section 2.2.4)**: The detailed comparison of parallel vs. serpentine flow fields can be reduced to a few sentences11111111. Since your model is a lumped-parameter model, the specific geometry of the flow field is less critical to explain in great detail. Figure 6 can be removed.
        
    - **PEM Degradation (Section 2.2.5)**: Summarize the main degradation mechanisms (membrane thinning, catalyst dissolution, gas crossover) into a single paragraph12. The key point is that degradation impacts long-term performance and cost, which is a factor in your techno-economic model.
        

---

#### **3. Techno-Economic and Renewable Energy Context (Condensed Section 2.3)**

- **Focus on the Research Gap**:
    
    - In the "Frameworks for Technoeconomic Analysis" section (2.3.1), briefly mention existing models like H2A but quickly pivot to their limitations‚Äînamely, their static nature and lack of integration with dynamic, physics-based models13131313. This directly justifies the novelty of your work.
        
- **Synthesize Cost Drivers**:
    
    - The "Cost Drivers for PEM hydrogen production" section (2.3.2) can be made more concise. The key takeaway is that electricity cost and capital expenditure (CAPEX) are the dominant factors141414141414141414. Figure 7 can be kept as it provides a good visual summary.
        
- **Integrate Renewable Energy Variability**:
    
    - Combine the discussion on renewable energy configurations (Section 2.3.3) with the cost driver analysis. The main point is that the choice of renewable source (solar, wind, hybrid) and its intermittency significantly impact the capacity factor and, therefore, the LCOH15. This provides a strong rationale for your integrated modeling approach.

$\alpha_a$, $\alpha_c$ are anodic and cathodic charge transfer coefficients ( $\alpha_a= 2.0$, $\alpha_c= 0.5$), applicable to both the anode (hydrogen oxidation) and cathode (oxygen reduction) reactions @marangioDirectHighPressure2009; @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013.

The oxygen anode, $i_{0,\text{anode}}$, is several orders of magnitude lower than $i_{0,\text{cathode}}$, making the anode activation loss dominant [@espinosa-lopezModellingExperimentalValidation2018]; [@garcia-valverdeSimplePEMWater2012]. Enhancing the anode exchange current density ($i_0$) to effectively accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can reduce the overpotential ($V_{act,anode}$).

In practice, separate Butler‚ÄìVolmer expressions are written for each electrode, including reactant concentrations.

Of course. I have reviewed the "Energy System Modeling" section of your thesis. This section is well-structured and covers the key aspects of modeling renewable energy sources for hydrogen production. My review identifies a few critical inconsistencies and some areas where the model's description could be clarified or improved for greater accuracy.

Here is a detailed analysis:

---

### Overall Summary

The section lays out standard modeling approaches for PV and wind systems and their integration. The primary issues are a critical symbol collision in the wind section (`Œª`), potentially overly simplified solar geometry, and logical flaws in the grid import/export equations which should be conditional. Addressing these will significantly improve the robustness of your model.

---

### 1. Critical Errors and Inconsistencies

These are the most important issues to address as they represent errors in the model's formulation.

- **Wind Section: Critical Symbol Collision (`Œª`)**
    
    - You have used the symbol `Œª` for two different concepts in the same section:
        1. **Tip Speed Ratio (TSR)** in the power coefficient `$C_p(\lambda, \beta)$` equation.
        2. **Weibull Scale Parameter** in the wind speed distribution `$f(v)$`.
    - This is a critical error that makes the model ambiguous and impossible to implement correctly.
    - **Recommendation:** Change one of the symbols. A common practice is to use **TSR** for the tip-speed ratio and keep `Œª` for the Weibull parameter. Alternatively, you could use `c` or `k` for the Weibull scale parameter (though `k` is already used for the shape parameter).
- **Integration Section: Flawed Logic for Grid Import/Export**
    
    - The equations for `$P_{import,h,y}$` and `$P_{export,h,y}$` are not conditional. As written, they will produce nonsensical negative values when renewable output is between the minimum and maximum electrolyzer capacity.
    - **Import Equation:** The current equation `$P_{import,h,y} = (0.05 \times P_{EL,rated}) - P_{RE,h,y}$` calculates a negative import if `$P_{RE,h,y}$` is greater than 5% of the electrolyzer's rating.
    - **Export Equation:** The current equation `$P_{export,h,y} = P_{RE,h,y} - P_{EL,rated}$` calculates a negative export if `$P_{RE,h,y}$` is less than the electrolyzer's rating.
    - **Recommendation:** Rewrite these using piecewise functions or conditional (IF/THEN) logic.
    
    Corrected Logic for Import:
    
    $$
    
    P_{\text{import},h,y} =
    
    \begin{cases}
    
    (0.05 \cdot P_{\text{EL,rated}}) - P_{\text{RE},h,y}, & \text{if } P_{\text{RE},h,y} < (0.05 \cdot P_{\text{EL,rated}}) \
    
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    
    \end{cases}
    
    $$
    
    Corrected Logic for Export:
    
    $$
    
    P_{\text{export},h,y} =
    
    \begin{cases}
    
    P_{\text{RE},h,y} - P_{\text{EL,rated}}, & \text{if } P_{\text{RE},h,y} > P_{\text{EL,rated}} \
    
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    
    \end{cases}
    
    $$
    

---

### 2. Conceptual Simplifications and Areas for Improvement

These are points where the model might be oversimplified or where clarity could be improved.

- **PV Section: Solar Geometry Model (`œÉ`)**
    
    - The equation for solar elevation angle, `$\sigma = 90 - \phi + \delta$`, is only valid for **solar noon**. Since you are performing an hourly analysis (indicated by the subscript `h`), using a static noon-time angle for every hour of the day will introduce significant error, especially during morning and evening hours.
    - **Recommendation:** To improve accuracy, you should use a formula for `œÉ` that includes the **hour angle (œâ)**, which changes by 15¬∞ per hour. The standard formula for solar elevation (or its complement, the zenith angle) depends on latitude, declination, and hour angle. Referencing a standard solar engineering text (like the cited Duffie & Beckman) will provide the correct, time-dependent formula.
- **PV Section: Power Loss Term (`$P_{losses}$`)**
    
    - The main PV power equation ends with `... \times P_{losses}`. This is dimensionally incorrect if `$P_{losses}$` is a power value (in Watts). Power losses are typically handled with a dimensionless efficiency or derating factor (e.g., between 0 and 1).
    - You later define `$f_{\rm derate}\approx0.90$` for systematic losses. The main equation should use this factor.
    - **Incorrect:** `... \left( 1 + \alpha_p \left( T_{PV}^{h} - T_{STC} \right) \right) P_{losses}`
    - **Correct:** `... \left( 1 + \alpha_p \left( T_{PV}^{h} - T_{STC} \right) \right) f_{\rm derate}` (Or combine `$f_{derPV,y}$` and `$f_{derate}$` into one overall loss factor).

---

### 3. Minor Inconsistencies and Suggestions for Clarity

- **PV Section:**
    
    - The PV module temperature is called `$T_{PV}^{h}$` in the main equation but is calculated as `$T_{\rm cell}[h]$`. Use one consistent symbol.
    - The irradiance used to calculate cell temperature, `G[h]`, is not defined. Clarify if this is the Global Horizontal Irradiance (`$GHI_h$`) or the Global Tilted Irradiance (`$GTI_h$`). (It should be `$GTI_h$`).
    - The panel tilt angle is `$\theta_{PV}$` in the text but `$\theta$` in the GTI equation. Use one consistent symbol.
- **Wind Section:**
    
    - The subscripts for wind speeds are inconsistent between the text (`$v_{\rm cut\text{-}in}, v_{\rm rated}, v_{\rm cut\text{-}out}$`) and the piecewise formula (`$v_c, v_r, v_s$`). Harmonize these for clarity (e.g., use `$v_{cin}, v_{r}, v_{cout}$` consistently).
    - The description of power output between cut-in and rated speed in the text (`output = $P_{\rm rated}\times\bigl(P_{\rm phys}(v)/P_{\rm phys}(v_{\rm rated})\bigr)`) is a good, practical approach. The corresponding formula (`$P_{wt}(v)`) is more ambiguous. Consider making the formula match the clear description in the text.
    - The reference to `<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> table3.3.2</mark>` should be a formal cross-reference.

By addressing these points, especially the critical `Œª` symbol collision and the grid interaction logic, your model will become much more rigorous and defendable.

Thank you for providing the updated section with equation numbers. This makes referencing specific points much easier.

I have reviewed the "Energy System Modeling" section again. While the structure is clear, all of the critical conceptual and logical errors identified in the previous review are still present. It is essential to address these for the model to be considered valid and robust.

Here is a summary of the required changes, with references to the new equation numbers.

---

### **1. Critical Errors That Must Be Corrected**

These issues represent fundamental flaws in the model as written and should be your highest priority.

- **Wind Section: Critical Symbol Collision (Œª)**
    
    - In equations **(50)** and **(51)**, `Œª` represents the **Tip-Speed Ratio**.
    - In equation **(52)**, `Œª` represents the **Weibull Scale Parameter**.
    - **This is a critical error.** You cannot use the same symbol for two different key parameters in the same model.
    - **Required Change:** You must change one of the symbols. For example, use `TSR` for the Tip-Speed Ratio and keep `Œª` for the Weibull parameter.
- **Integration Section: Flawed Logic for Grid Import/Export (Eq. 55 & 56)**
    
    - The logic in these equations is incorrect because it is not conditional. As written, they will calculate negative import and export, which is physically meaningless.
    - **Equation (55):** This will incorrectly calculate a negative import whenever renewable power is greater than the electrolyzer's 5% minimum load.
    - **Equation (56):** This will incorrectly calculate a negative export whenever renewable power is less than the electrolyzer's rated power.
    - **Required Change:** You must rewrite these using conditional (piecewise) functions.

- **PV Section: Incorrect Power Loss Term (Eq. 43)**
    
    - The term `P_losses` at the end of equation **(43)** is described as a power value, but it is used as a multiplicative factor. This is dimensionally incorrect.
    - **Required Change:** Replace `P_losses` with the dimensionless derating factor `f_{derate}` that you define later in the text (`f_{derate} \approx 0.90`).

### **2. Recommendations for Model Accuracy and Clarity**

These points address oversimplifications and inconsistencies that weaken the model's credibility.

- **PV Section: Oversimplified Solar Angle (Eq. 46)**
    
    - Equation **(46)** for the solar elevation angle `œÉ` is only valid for **solar noon**. Using this for an **hourly** simulation (as implied by `$P_{PV,hY}$`) is a significant oversimplification and will lead to inaccurate results for PV generation, as it ignores the sun's movement across the sky during the day.
    - **Recommendation:** For an hourly model, you must use a formula for `œÉ` that includes the **hour angle (œâ)**. Please consult a solar engineering textbook for the correct time-dependent equation.
- **Missing Equation Number:** There is no equation numbered **(45)**. Your numbering jumps from (44) to (46).
    
- **Undefined and Inconsistent Symbols:**
    
    - **In Eq. (48):** The irradiance `G[h]` is not defined. You must state if this is GHI or GTI (it should be GTI).
    - **In Eq. (43) vs. (48):** The PV cell temperature is `T_{PV}^{h}` in one place and `T_{cell}[h]` in another. Use a single, consistent symbol.
    - **In Eq. (44) vs. text:** The panel tilt angle is `Œ∏` in the equation but `Œ∏_{PV}` in the text. Be consistent.
    - **In the Wind Section:** The subscripts for wind speeds are inconsistent between the text (`v_cut-in`, etc.) and Equation **(53)** (`v_c`, `v_s`, etc.). Please make them consistent.

Please prioritize fixing the three critical errors. Addressing the other recommendations will then further strengthen the accuracy and clarity of your thesis.
