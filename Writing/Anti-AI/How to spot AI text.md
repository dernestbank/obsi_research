AI likes to give a multitude of lists using oxford commas and tends to summarize even the smallest chunks of writing. Also, the use of “So,” in your writing is a human factor. Not to mention parenthetical details and backslashes.

In the numbered list, the bot also uses colons rather than your hyphen with a space on one side but not the other.

**The Common Culprits**

AI-generated content often falls into recognizable patterns. Here are some common signs and how to rehumanize them:

**1. Overuse of Buzzwords**

AI loves buzzwords like "transformative" and "ever-evolving" or phrases like “in the realm of” or “meticulously navigate.” These terms may sound impressive but add little to the substance of the content. Choose simple, more direct language that conveys your message without unnecessary bluster to maintain the human touch (for example, impact, shape, or framework).

**2. Vague Verbs**

AI often chooses words like "foster" for their versatility, but it leads to generic and uninspired writing. Go with more specific verbs that clearly articulate the action or effect you're discussing, like create, build, or nurture.

**3. Metaphors and Similes**

AI tends to overuse phrases like "think of X as ..." or comparisons using "like" or "it’s like." While metaphors and similes can enrich writing, their overuse or inappropriate application can detract from the content's authenticity. Be prudent and original using figurative language. Respect your audience; they’re already thinking.

**4. Repetitive Sentence Structures**

AI-generated content often features monotonous sentence structures, such as the overreliance on "not only … but also …" To make your writing dynamic, vary sentence lengths and structures. A mix of short, punchy sentences and longer, more complex ones can enhance readability and engagement.

**5. Unnecessary Complexity**

AI sometimes defaults to passive voice, complex sentence constructions, and jargon to convey simple ideas. If your prompts are vague and lack context, the tool may hallucinate and make things up. Remember, clarity trumps complexity. Aim for concise, clear sentences that anyone can understand.

**Follow the Rhythm of Writing**

A clear indicator of AI writing is little variation in sentence length. AI produces paragraphs with uniform sentence structures, leading to a monotonous reading experience. To counter this, adopt a natural rhythm in your writing by varying sentence lengths. Use the "short—long—short" pattern to introduce variety and mimic the flow of human thinking.

**Embracing AI with a Human Touch**

AI-assisted writing is here to stay, but the key to leveraging it lies in editing and giving it a human touch. Tools like ChatGPT are good at writing imperfect content quickly and need a guiding hand. That's where we come in. By staying vigilant and refining our editing practices, our work will retain warmth, creativity, and complexity.

**AI essays tend to get straight to the point.** Human-written work often gradually leads up to its topic, offering personal anecdotes, definitions or rhetorical questions before getting to the topic at hand.

**AI-generated essays are often list-like.** They may feature numbered body paragraphs or multiple headings and subheadings.

**The paragraphs of AI-generated essays also often begin with formulaic transitional phrases.** As an example, here are the first words of each paragraph in one essay that ChatGPT produced:

1. “Firstly”
2. “In contrast”
3. “Furthermore”
4. “On the other hand”
5. “In conclusion.”

Notably, AI-generated essays were far more likely than human-written essays to begin paragraphs with “Furthermore,” “Moreover” and “Overall.”

**AI-generated work is often banal.** It does not break new ground or demonstrate originality; its assertions sound familiar.

**AI-generated text tends to remain in the third person.** That’s the case even when asked a reader response–style question. For example, when I asked ChatGPT what it personally found intriguing, meaningful or resonant about one of Edgar Allan Poe’s poems, it produced six paragraphs, but the pronoun “I” was included only once. The rest of the text described the poem’s atmosphere, themes and use of language in dispassionate prose. Grammarly prefaced its answer with “I’m sorry, but I cannot have preferences as I am an AI-powered assistant and do not have emotions or personal opinions,” followed by similarly clinical observations about the text.


**AI-produced text tends to discuss “readers” being “challenged” to “confront” ideologies or being “invited” to “reflect” on key topics.** In contrast, I have found that human-written text tends to focus on hypothetically what “the reader” might “see,” “feel” or “learn.”

**AI-generated essays are often confidently wrong.** Human writing is more prone to hedging, using phrases like “I think,” “I feel,” “this might mean …” or “this could be a symbol of …” and so on.

**AI-generated essays are often repetitive.** An essay that ChatGPT produced on the setting of Rebecca Harding Davis’s short story “Life in the Iron Mills” contained the following assertions among its five brief paragraphs: “The setting serves as a powerful symbol,” “the industrial town itself serves as a central aspect of the setting,” “the roar of furnaces serve as a constant reminder of the relentless pace of industrial production,” “the setting serves as a catalyst for the characters’ struggles and aspirations,” “the setting serves as a microcosm of the larger societal issues of the time,” and “the setting … serves as a powerful symbol of the dehumanizing effects of industrialization.”


**AI writing is often hyperbolic or overreaching.** The quotes above describe a “powerful symbol,” for example. AI essays frequently describe even the most mundane topics as “groundbreaking,” “vital,” “esteemed,” “invaluable,” “indelible,” “essential,” “poignant” or “profound.”

**AI-produced texts frequently use metaphors, sometimes awkwardly.** ChatGPT produced several essays that compared writing to “weaving” a “rich” or “intricate tapestry” or “painting” a “vivid picture.”

**AI-generated essays tend to overexplain.** They often use appositives to define people or terms, as in “Margaret Fuller, a pioneering feminist and transcendentalist thinker, explored themes such as individualism, self-reliance and the search for meaning in her writings …”

**AI-generated academic writing often employs certain verbs.** They include “delve,” “shed light,” “highlight,” “illuminate,” “underscore,” “showcase,” “embody,” “transcend,” “navigate,” “foster,” “grapple,” “strive,” “intertwine,” “espouse” and “endeavor.”

**AI-generated essays tend to end with a **sweeping**** **broad-scale statement.** They talk about “the human condition,” “American society,” “the search for meaning” or “the resilience of the human spirit.” Texts are often described as a “testament to” variations on these concepts.

**AI-generated writing often invents sources.** ChatGPT can compose a “research paper” using MLA-style in-text parenthetical citations and Works Cited entries that look correct and convincing, but the supposed sources are often nonexistent. In my experiment, ChatGPT referenced a purported article titled “Poe, ‘The Fall of the House of Usher,’ and the Gothic’s Creation of the Unconscious,” which it claimed was published in _PMLA_, vol. 96, no. 5, 1981, pp. 900–908. The author cited was an actual Poe scholar, but this particular article does not appear on his CV, and while volume 96, number 5 of _PMLA_ did appear in 1981, the pages cited in that issue of _PMLA_ actually span two articles: one on _Frankenstein_ and one on lyric poetry.

**AI-generated essays include hallucinations.** Ted Chiang’s [article](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) on this phenomenon offers a useful explanation for why large language models such as ChatGPT generate fabricated facts and incorrect assertions. My AI-generated essays included references to nonexistent events, characters and quotes. For example, ChatGPT attributed the dubious quote “Half invoked, half spontaneous, full of ill-concealed enthusiasms, her wild heart lay out there” to a lesser-known short story by Herman Melville, yet nothing resembling that quote appears in the actual text. More hallucinations were evident when AI was generating text about less canonical or more recently published literary texts.

This is not an exhaustive list, and I know that AI-generated text in other formats or relating to other fields probably features different patterns and [tendencies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2024/03/27/the-tell-tale-signs-students-are-using-chatgpt-to-help-write-their-essays/?sh=7f8c0e9e73e5). I also used only very basic prompts and did not delineate many specific parameters for the output beyond the topic and the format of an essay.

It is also important to remember that the attributes I’ve described are not exclusive to AI-generated texts. In fact, I noticed that the phrase “It is important to … [note/understand/consider]” was a frequent sentence starter in AI-generated work, but, as evidenced in the previous sentence, humans use these constructions, too. After all, large language models train on human-generated text.

### **1. Zero grammatical inconsistencies or errors.**

It’s very rare for an AI content generator to make grammatical mistakes. Unless the writer has prompted their AI tool with error-riddled text, to begin with, the tool will follow guidelines for correct grammar and syntax.

On the other hand, human-written copy is ripe with errors; it’s part of the creative process that AI tools can’t replicate.

### **2. Repetition or redundancy of words or phrases.**

Think of AI text generators as pattern followers. These tools aren’t freethinking in the same way that a human is – they identify and follow patterns, which means that AI-generated copy tends to use the same words and phrases over and over.

### **3. An absence of emotion or personality.**

This is a big one: humans are great at infusing text with personality and emotion. And yes, it’s possible to push an AI tool toward flowery language if you’re particularly skilled at steering it. But for the most part, AI-generated copy is **derivative and emotionless.**

### **4. Factual errors.**

AI text generators are particularly convincing when it comes to ‘stating facts’ – but they’re all bark and no bite. Statistics generated with AI are usually outdated or downright falsified.

As Steve Shwartz [wrote on his blog](https://www.aiperspectives.com/blog/), _AI Perspectives_: “GPT-3 has no commonsense understanding of the meaning of its input texts or the text that is generated. **It is just a statistical model.”**

### **5. Unusual choice of words.**

When you’re looking for AI-generated copy, keep an eye out for unusual words or phrases. Human writers don’t tend to use the same words over and over; instead, they mix them up with synonyms and different sentence structures.

AI tools may appear convincing at first, but if you look closely enough, you’ll quickly spot the **lack of variation** in their language.

(It’s quite funny, actually – the tools tend to have their favorite catchphrases on speed dial, like “well-oiled machine,” which they use religiously as the opportunity strikes).

### **6. Lack of context; irrelevance.**

Ever read an article that seems to be following a logical progression, but suddenly goes off the rails and starts talking about something entirely unrelated? That’s AI-generated copy for you. **AI tools don’t understand context** – they can only provide information that their ‘inputs’ tell them to.

### **7. Lack of tone and style.**

Unless you are a particularly skilled content generator, it is immensely difficult to make an [**AI text**](http://identify-ai-generated-text/) generator embody a unique tone of voice. The default is (unfortunately) bland, disinteresting language that makes you go, “well, duh.”

If you keep these seven differences in mind while you’re reading, you should be able to quickly identify AI-generated copy before it sabotages your website or business.
