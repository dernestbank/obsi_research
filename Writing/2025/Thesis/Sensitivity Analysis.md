Three sensitivity analyses were conducted: 
1) Single Variable Tornado Charts in which one parameter was varied, all others were held fixed at the baseline case values, and the new cost was recorded (Table 4, Figure 3 and Figure 5). 
2) Two Variable Contour Plots in which electricity cost and stack electrical usage were varied within the bounded ranges and the resulting hydrogen cost plotted in a contour graph (

3) Monte Carlo Analysis in which all Table 2 parameters were stochastically and simultaneously varied over their full range to create a probability distribution function of potential hydrogen costs (Table 1).
