Thicker GDLs can cause higher concentration overpotentials at high current due to longer diffusion paths (and slightly higher in-plane resistance for electron flow). Catalyst layer thickness must balance having enough catalyst/electrolyte interface versus mass transport limits; typical CL thickness is only ~5–20 μm. 
he **membrane thickness** strongly affects ohmic loss and water crossover. A thicker membrane increases ionic path length (linearly raising $\eta_{\text{ohm}}$) but also reduces gas crossover and improves durability. However, a very thick membrane may require higher compression and can increase the cell’s internal resistance, so an optimal thickness is chosen. @hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015





The water balance in the membrane involves electro-osmotic drag from anode to cathode, back-diffusion from cathode to anode, and any net production or consumption at the interfaces @leeThreeDimensionalTransportModeling2008


where $i_L$ is the limiting current density.
Faraday's laws give the molar rate of water consumption and gas production. @hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 

 
 the concentrations at the anode surface as electrode interface $c_{i}$ and the reference position $i_{r}$ can be related as
$$
V_m = \frac{RT}{zF} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{c_i}{c_r} \right)
$$

Larger concentration gradients lead to increased diffusion potential. a greater availability of reactants at the reaction surface exacerbates mass transport limitations. Moreover at high current densities, the rapid formation of numerous bubbles creates a barrier, preventing contact between the electrode and electrolyte, and thus diminishing catalyst efficiency. Optimizing the flow rate can mitigate the impact of these bubbles. @zhangAccurateEfficientMachine2023 , @eigeldingerBubbleCoverageGasevolving2000

3.1 Electrochemical Modeling and Materials Advances in PEM Electrolysis

A lot of studies have been done on the modeling the electrochemical reactions in PEM electrolyser systems.  However, formulation details can vary across literature but the fundamental model should account for the overpotential losses @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . The key loss terms include activation overpotentials, ohmic losses and concentration overpotentials. The activation overpotential occurs at anode and cathode, due to sluggish reaction kinetics. The ohmic losses is due to the ionic resistance in the membrane and electronic resistances in electrodes/interconnects, The concentration or mass transport overpotentials are also caused by gas bubble accumulation and reactant depletion at high current densities @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Dynamic models have also been developed (including capacitive terms for transient response), but many studies focus on steady-state performance unless coupling to renewable power profiles where transient behavior is important @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 Hydrogen produced at the cathode can permeate through the polymer membrane to the oxygen side (and vice versa for oxygen to the hydrogen side), especially at high pressure or with thinner membranes. This effect lowers the Faraday efficiency. Faraday efficiency $\eta_F$ is the fraction of the theoretical hydrogen production that is actually realized. A $\eta_F$ less than 100% is caused by shunt currents and gas losses through the membrane @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Shunt currents are influenced by stack design and materials (e.g. conductive paths in the bipolar plates) @yodwongFaradaysEfficiencyModeling2020 . On-line mass spectrometry tests have shown that hydrogen permeation rates increase with current density (due to supersaturation of dissolved H₂ in the catalyst layer), and that thin membranes dramatically boost gas crossover, requiring mitigation to avoid explosive H₂/O₂ mixtures at low loads  @berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020 . Empirical equations from  Hug and Ulleberg have used to fit $\eta_F$ as a function of current density, pressure, and temperature  @ullebergModelingAdvancedAlkaline2003,  @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 .
Efforts on PEM electrolyser modeling span from lumped zero-dimensional (0D) approaches up to full three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 .  Different levels of fidelity are chosen based on the modeling goals. Simpler models are used for control and large-scale simulations whereas 3D models are used for detailed design optimization @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Briguglio _et al._ (2013) carried out a 3D CFD analysis of a 10-cell PEM stack with 120 parallel channels, finding that a well-designed flow distributor yielded uniform water flow and homogeneous pressure across all cells  @briguglioDesignTestingCompact2013 . Such 3D studies help ensure there are no starvation or flooding spots in scale-up designs. On the other hand, zero-dimensional dynamic models (e.g. using empirical polarization curves and differential equations for system dynamics) have been used to simulate how a PEM electrolyzer responds to transient power input or to perform fast design-sensitivity analyses @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 .

In addition to flow channels, the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) configuration influences performance. PEM electrolyzers typically use a zero-gap configuration, where the catalyst-coated membrane is pressed directly against porous transport layers (PTLs) that also serve as gas diffusion layers. This minimizes resistance by placing catalysts in intimate contact with the membrane. MEAs can be fabricated via catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) approach (catalyst ink applied directly on the membrane, e.g. by spraying or screen-printing) or by gas diffusion electrode (GDE) approach (catalyst coated onto a diffusion layer and then assembled against the membrane)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The CCM method (often via decal transfer): catalyst ink containing platinum or iridium particles and ionomer is **sprayed** or blade-coated onto a Teflon substrate, dried and hot-pressed onto the membrane @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . This yields a controlled catalyst loading and uniform layer on the membrane. The structure of the catalyst layer (porosity, thickness, ionomer content) is critical – it must allow water access and gas escape while providing ionic contact to the membrane and electronic contact to the electrode. Different fabrication techniques (spraying, painting, physical deposition) and catalyst ink formulations can lead to different microstructures and performance. Research has shown that achieving a homogeneous, well-dispersed catalyst layer improves utilization of precious metals and can allow lower loadings without sacrificing performance @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . For instance, earlier PEMWE designs often had very high platinum loadings on the cathode, but it was realized that hydrogen evolution is facile and does not require such excess catalyst. Cathode loadings dropped into the ~0.5–1.0 mg/cm² range without performance loss   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The anode (oxygen evolution) side is more challenging; typical Iridium loadings were ~2 mg/cm² and have not dramatically decreased historically @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . New coating methods (e.g. depositing iridium nanoparticles onto conductive supports, or advanced sputtering techniques) have achieved lower Ir loadings – in one study to ~0.3 mg/cm² – while maintaining performance @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 .
Aside from catalysts, other design factors include the membrane thickness and reinforcement (mechanical supports or cloth within the membrane to improve strength) and the use of advanced coatings on bipolar plates or PTLs (such as titanium coatings or hydrophilic treatments) to enhance durability and performance. Each of these design choices – flow field pattern, MEA fabrication method, catalyst loading – can significantly affect efficiency, voltage performance, and durability of the electrolyzer. @ahmedEffectComponentsOperating2022; @escobedoDesignConstructionPerformance2023

Conventional PEM electrolyzers use perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer membranes (e.g. Nafion™) due to their high proton conductivity and chemical stability.  However, PFSA membranes are expensive and have some limitations. They have an upper thermal limit around 80–90 °C @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 
 recent advances have yielded hydrocarbon MEAs approaching the performance of PFSA-based systems  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Hydrocarbon ionomers can have higher glass transition temperatures and potentially allow operation at >100 °C, addressing PFSA’s thermal limitation @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Still, a known issue is that thinner membranes (whether PFSA or hydrocarbon) lead to higher gas crossover; for example, state-of-the-art PFSA electrolyzers often use thick membranes (e.g. Nafion 115 at 125 μm or even N117 at 180 μm) to minimize hydrogen permeation  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Using thinner membranes would improve conductivity and efficiency, but at the expense of more crossover and potentially reduced mechanical durability @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 
Non-precious OER catalysts (e.g. transition metal oxides without Ir) have been investigated (such as cobalt or manganese oxides), but so far none can match the stability of Ir-based catalysts in acidic PEM conditions for long lifetimes @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The durability of these new materials is a major focus , since any new material must still achieve the >5–10 year lifetimes expected of electrolyzer stacks @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 
Despite these advances, two primary gaps persist in the electrochemical literature. First, most models remain 1D or pseudo-1D, addressing through-plane transport without capturing the complex interplay of flow-field design, lateral current distribution, and multi-phase water management under dynamic load. Second, while individual studies have examined membrane alternatives or catalyst substitutions, few have systematically linked material property variations to techno-economic outcomes. This disconnect impedes efforts to identify which materials investments truly yield cost-effective performance improvements when scaled to commercial module sizes. Our work seeks to address these gaps by embedding a validated 0D/1D model within a multi-objective optimization framework that directly quantifies how variations in membrane conductivity, catalyst loading, and electrode porosity affect both energy efficiency and capital cost.

 Techno-Economic Analysis and System-Level Modeling



Several open-source frameworks have been developed for the techno-economic analysis (TEA) of hydrogen production systems, including H2A, HySupply, and Techno-Economic Simulation Tool (TechEST) (Abe et al., 2022; Schmidt et al., 2017). These platforms provide valuable tools for evaluating the cost and performance of various hydrogen pathways. However, most existing models are fundamentally static, often lacking dynamic integration between physical system modeling and process economics. This limitation can result in oversimplified assessments that do not fully capture the temporal variability of renewable energy inputs or operational flexibility of electrolyzer systems (Abe et al., 2022; Schmidt et al., 2017).

Recent updates to proprietary software, such as AspenTech’s V14.1, have introduced modules for detailed PEM electrolyzer design and operation, enabling more granular process simulation. Despite these advancements, affordability and accessibility remain significant barriers, particularly for startups and early-stage technology developers, who may lack the resources to invest in high-cost commercial software (Abe et al., 2022).
To address these gaps, several literature have model and optimize water electrolysis systems.

 TEA methodologies in the past decade have evolved from straightforward cost accounting to more sophisticated models that can account for manufacturing scale, temporal operation patterns, and integration into energy networks. Chung _et al._ (2024) introduced a combined physics-based electrolyzer model with an optimization routine to evaluate both steady and dynamic operations on LCOH @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . Such methods go beyond static cost calculations, examining how capacity optimization, scheduling, and even demand response could impact economics
 manufacturing cost models that estimate how the cost per kW of the stack (and BoP) decreases with larger production volume and system size. @badgettUpdatedManufacturedCost2024; @mayyasManufacturingCostAnalysis2019 
Similarly, learning curve models predict that for every doubling of cumulative production, the unit cost falls by a certain percentage (the “learning rate”) @badgettKeyPerformanceIndicators2023 
Recent analyses and historical data suggest significant cost improvements as manufacturing ramps up. Yates et al. (2020) identified electrolyzer system size as the single most important factor influencing hydrogen cost. In their model, scaling the nominal electrolyzer power up by a factor of 10 could reduce LCOH by around $0.3 per kg (all else equal)  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 .
The reasoning is straightforward: larger systems spread fixed costs (like control systems, housing, etc.) over more output, and higher production volumes of stacks enable automated manufacturing, bulk material purchasing, and design optimization for mass production.
The U.S. DOE H2A case studies utilizes linear capital cost model for distributed and central PEM plant.  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . This is approach is limits to the effect of a learning curve and economies of scale. 
A better approach is somewhat reported in literature. Astraini et al curve fitted  uninstalled capital cost-capacity $(P_{EL,rated})$ scaling relationships for electrolyzer stacks system @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . $\mathrm{Cost}_{\text{EL}}=c_{1}+c_{2}\,P_{\text{EL,rated}}+c_{3}\,\exp\bigl(c_{4}\,P_{\text{EL,rated}}\bigr)\,$ 
Reksten et al. modeled the capital cost of PEM electrolyser system to predict the cost of PEM electrolyzers to the plant capacity (Q). For $C = \left(k_o + \frac{k}{Q^{\alpha}}\right) \left(\frac{V}{V_o}\right)^{\beta}$  where Ko and k are fitting constants, Q and  V and Vo represent  plant capacity, the plant installation year and reference year respectively. @rekstenProjectingFutureCost2022

PEM stacks (membrane, electrodes, bipolar plates, etc.) typically account for roughly 40–50% of the total installed system cost, while BoP (power electronics, gas dryers, pumps, cooling system, housing, etc.) accounts for the other ~50–60% @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 .  For instance, a study showed stack ~41% and BoP ~59% of direct costs in a forecourt-scale system, and a similar split in a larger central system @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . Within the stack cost, the expensive components are the membrane and catalysts (iridium in particular): these high materials costs mean that even if their quantities are small, they contribute a significant share. One analysis estimated that the catalyst and membrane together could be ~15–20% of the total system cost in current designs @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . BoP cost drivers include the DC power supply/rectifier (often a big cost item), and any hydrogen compression or drying equipment needed. In certain designs, if high-pressure hydrogen output is required, the electrolyzer may be designed to pressurize hydrogen internally, which shifts some cost from an external compressor into the cell components (thicker endplates, etc.).
Many studies assume a stack lifetime of ~60,000–80,000 hours (7–9 years at full usage) for future PEM systems though current demonstrated lifetimes are somewhat lower @krishnanPresentFutureCost2023 . Shorter stack life means more frequent replacements and higher effective cost per kg H₂, unless mitigated by warranties or refurbishments.
Recent literature reports a range of levelized hydrogen costs for PEM electrolysis, depending on assumptions about technology status, scale, and energy inputs.  For current (circa 2020) technology at scale, **LCOH values around $4–$7 per kg** are common in studies @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . The 2035 scenario from Chung _et al._ where LCOH might hit $1.4/kg is an optimistic case that assumes significant technology and cost improvements @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . It suggests that by mid-2030s, PEM electrolysis _could_ produce hydrogen in the $1–$2/kg range in favorable regions (e.g. with abundant cheap renewables), which would undercut even methane reforming with carbon capture. In the nearer term, analyses indicate that reaching about $2/kg (a often-cited benchmark for competitiveness with grey hydrogen plus carbon pricing) is plausible by the late 2020s if certain conditions are met: roughly, electricity at $20/MWh or below, electrolyzer capital costs halved from today, and high utilization (or some form of revenue stacking/grid services to compensate if utilization is low). Many studies show current costs in the $5/kg ballpark, so getting to $2 involves roughly a 60% cost reduction – which aligns with expected improvements from scale and cheaper renewables.
The H2A case studies showed that a forecourt-scale unit (1,500 kg H₂/day, ~5 MW) had a hydrogen cost about $5.15/kg, while a central plant (50,000 kg/day, ~165 MW) was about $5.12/kg under similar assumptions – indicating that scale alone in that comparison didn’t change it dramatically because both were assumed to run at high capacity  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . But when including _distribution_ costs (compression, storage, dispensing for the forecourt), the smaller-scale case ended up around $7.5/kg delivered   @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 .



 Energy-System Integration for PEM Hydrogen

Subsequent work—for instance, by Turner et al. (2019)—incorporated detailed cost-scaling relationships for electrolyzer stacks and balance-of-plant (BoP) components
Turner’s model highlighted that economies of scale in stack manufacturing (driven by learning-curve effects) and BoP standardization accounted for more than 30 % of potential LCOH reductions. Nevertheless, these static TEA studies still assumed constant capacity factors (often 90 %), thereby missing the critical impact of renewable intermittency on plant utilization and hydrogen cost.

Integrating renewable-energy variability into TEA frameworks has been a growing focus. A 2024 techno-economic assessment highlighted that PV-wind hybrid systems reduce LCOH to $3.01/kg by leveraging complementary generation patterns. @baralTechnoeconomicAssessmentGreen2024 hybrid wind-PV scenarios achieve the lowest LCOH due to higher capacity factors and lower electricity prices compared to solar-only systems. The IEEJ study compared "surplus power" (using curtailed renewables) and "stable power" (dedicated renewable plants) configurations. While surplus power reduced electrolyzer capacity factors to 5–13%, stable power designs achieved 50–70% capacity factors by mitigating intermittency, albeit with higher upfront infrastructure costs. @shibataEconomicAnalysisHydrogen2015
This result was achieved through multi-objective optimization of system design, accounting for renewable resource variability and storage integration, and highlights the potential of hybrid renewable systems to significantly improve both utilization rates and economic performance for green hydrogen production @suCapacityConfigurationOptimization2023.
 
Beyond capacity factors, geographic sensitivity analyses have illustrated that LCOH can vary by $2–3 kg⁻¹ across different U.S. regions due to differences in renewable resource quality, electricity tariffs, and permitting costs. For instance, wind-rich regions like ERCOT (Texas) achieve LCOH as low as $3.74/kg with tax credits, while California’s higher grid prices and lower wind capacity factors result in costs exceeding $5/kg @saurUSGeographicAnalysis2011 . Similarly, regions with frequent negative electricity prices (e.g., western Texas) enable cheaper hydrogen production by leveraging curtailed renewable energy @Section45VClean  
A further dimension of recent TEA research involves policy incentives and carbon pricing. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced production tax credits (PTC) of up to $3 kg⁻¹ H₂ for electrolyzers sourcing low-carbon electricity, effectively lowering LCOH by 30–50 % under favorable conditions @bistlinePowerSectorImpacts2023 . Yet, studies by Bracci (2023) caution that PTC eligibility criteria such as hourly emissions intensity thresholds require granular, hourly modeling to accurately capture compliance risk and revenue streams @45VHydrogenTax , @bracciCostComparisonVarious2023 . This motivates coupling TEA with time-resolved emissions data a complexity seldom addressed in earlier static analyses.

1. **Preamble – Global Context and Policy Landscape**

Hydrogen is increasingly seen as a pivotal energy carrier in global decarbonization strategies, driving a surge of international and U.S. policies to promote  greenhydrogen production. By the end of 2019 only five countries had issued national hydrogen strategies, but a year later nearly 20 countries had released plans (with at least 10 more forthcoming), and industry had announced ~25 GW of electrolyzer capacity for green hydrogen by 2026 @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . In the European Union, hydrogen features prominently in climate initiatives (e.g. the “Fit for 55” package and REPowerEU plan) with targets for tens of gigawatts of electrolyzers by 2030, alongside regulations to define **renewable hydrogen**. The United States has also made hydrogen a cornerstone of clean energy policy: the Department of Energy’s “Hydrogen Shot” aims for “1 $1 kg in 1 decade,” i.e. $1/kg H₂ by 2031 @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021  @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021 , and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act created a new **Section 45V** clean hydrogen production tax credit up to $3 per kg @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . This 10-year production credit (45V) provides the maximum $3/kg incentive for hydrogen produced with a life-cycle carbon intensity <0.45 kg CO₂e per kg H₂ @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . Additionally, projects can opt for a 30% investment tax credit in lieu of the production credit if they commence construction by 2033 and meet labor standards @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . Such generous incentives, alongside $8 billion appropriated for at least four regional clean hydrogen hubs (now expanded to seven hubs) @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 , signal robust U.S. federal support to accelerate a low-cost, clean hydrogen economy.
A critical regulatory development around  greenhydrogen is the definition of criteria for **additionality, deliverability, and temporal matching** of renewable power. These principles are intended to ensure that electrolytic hydrogen credited as “clean” is truly powered by new, clean energy sources rather than diverting existing generation. The U.S. Treasury’s proposed rules for 45V (and the finalized guidance in 2024) included three pillars for grid-connected electrolyzers using renewable electricity: (i) **Incrementality** – the renewable power source must be new or incremental (generally in operation ≤36 months before the H₂ facility)[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=hydrogen%20producers%20to%20assert%20low,area%20as%20the%20hydrogen%20production)[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=,that%20have%20mandated%20renewable%20portfolio); (ii) **Temporal matching** – the hydrogen production must be matched in time with renewable generation (hourly matching to be required by 2030)[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=hydrogen%20producers%20to%20assert%20low,area%20as%20the%20hydrogen%20production)[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=,the%20GHG%20emissions%20requirements%20that); and (iii) **Geographical deliverability** – the renewable source must be located in the same region or electrically deliverable to the electrolyzer[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=incremental%20to%20existing%20renewable%20or,source%20be%20located%20in%20the)[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=hour%20basis%20as%20long%20as,taxpayers%20can%20import%20clean%20energy). In other words, projects claiming the credit via grid power need to procure Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) from new renewable plants, ensure those EACs correspond to the same hour of H₂ production (after a transitional period of annual matching up to 2030), and source power from the same or an adjacent grid region[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=hydrogen%20producers%20to%20assert%20low,area%20as%20the%20hydrogen%20production)[bakerbotts.com](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2024/december/final-section-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-regulations-issued#:~:text=hour%20basis%20as%20long%20as,taxpayers%20can%20import%20clean%20energy). These requirements are designed to guarantee that “clean” hydrogen production truly adds renewable energy to the system and minimizes associated CO₂. The EU has pursued a similar approach in its Delegated Act on Renewable Hydrogen, emphasizing **additionality** of renewables, **temporal** and **geographic correlation** for grid-supplied electricity.

Over 95% of global hydrogen (approximately 70–90 million tonnes annually) is produced via steam methane reforming of natural gas or coal gasification, processes that emit large volumes of CO₂  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . This status quo yields cheap hydrogen (often $1–2/kg) but negates climate goals. Transitioning to green hydrogen (from electrolysis with renewable power) or even lower-carbon **“blue” hydrogen** (from fossil fuels with carbon capture) will require massive investment and policy support @GreenHydrogenCost2020  @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . The cost of green hydrogen currently averages 2–3 times higher than blue hydrogen; for example, fossil-based H₂ can cost $1–3/kg, whereas electrolytic hydrogen using low-carbon electricity is about $3.5–7.5/kg under current costs @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . This gap is primarily because electricity input dominates production cost – roughly 50–60% of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) – making green H₂ very sensitive to power prices @GreenHydrogenCost2020  @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . High capital costs of electrolyzers are the second major factor @GreenHydrogenCost2020 .
A **hydrogen economy instability** arises in that without significant cost reductions or carbon pricing, clean hydrogen cannot easily compete with incumbent grey hydrogen @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024  @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 .
Material constraints could create instability: proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers rely on scarce **iridium** (for catalysts) and **gallium/platinum-coated** components, and a rapid scale-up in PEM deployment could strain the supply or drive up prices of these critical materials  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . For instance, iridium is one of the rarest elements in Earth’s crust (~0.001 ppm) and wider adoption of PEM electrolysis would significantly increase global Ir demand (currently also driven by electronics and catalysis), risking price escalation  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . This supply risk underscores the importance of R&D into thrifting or substituting noble metals in electrolyzers
Despite these hurdles, projections for hydrogen’s role in a low-carbon future are optimistic.  @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024  @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . Nonetheless, planned deployments are growing rapidly. Recent data from the International Energy Agency’s Hydrogen Projects Database documented 1,219 hydrogen projects worldwide slated for commissioning between 2020 and 2030 @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 .
Hydrogen is often classified by a **color taxonomy** denoting production method and carbon footprint. **Green hydrogen** refers to H₂ produced via water electrolysis powered by renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, etc.), yielding zero direct CO₂ emissions @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . **Grey hydrogen** is made from fossil fuels without emissions mitigation (e.g. natural gas reforming or coal gasification releasing CO₂ to the air) @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . **Blue hydrogen** is similarly fossil-derived but with carbon capture and storage applied to reduce net CO₂ emissions. “Blue” is considered a lower-carbon interim solution, though its life-cycle emissions depend on capture efficiency and methane leakage. **Brown/black hydrogen** typically refer to hydrogen from coal (brown for lignite, black for bituminous) without CCS, which has the highest CO₂ emissions. **Pink (or purple) hydrogen** denotes hydrogen produced by electrolysis powered by nuclear energy (zero carbon electricity that is not renewable). There are also terms like **“turquoise” hydrogen** for hydrogen from methane pyrolysis (splitting natural gas into H₂ and solid carbon) and **“white” hydrogen** for the rare case of naturally occurring geologic hydrogen. While these colorful labels aid discussion, in practice hydrogen is further judged by purity and usage standards. The **ISO 14687** standard specifies two grades of hydrogen fuel for PEM fuel cell road vehicles: _Type I Grade D_ (gaseous) and _Type II Grade D_ (liquid) hydrogen[cdn.standards.iteh.ai](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/55078/5378e417754e4b4cb4efde3eb31eeb44/ISO-14687-3-2014.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20INTERNATIONAL%20STANDARD%20ISO%2014687,2)[shimadzu.com](https://www.shimadzu.com/an/industries/new-energy/fuel-cells/hydrogen-energy/index.html#:~:text=The%20hydrogen%20fuel%20standard%20for,play%20a%20role%20in). Type I Grade D gaseous hydrogen, used for compressed H₂ tanks in cars and buses, must have a minimum hydrogen content of 99.97% (fuel index) with total non-H₂ impurities ≤300 µmol/mol[commercialfuelsolutions.co.uk](https://commercialfuelsolutions.co.uk/hydrogen/grade-D-gaseous-hydrogen/?srsltid=AfmBOorP-D3-6AZvG44690m-IrninFDkydgyOdHx-QXniaK_eTlaQOTF#:~:text=Type%20I%2C%20Grade%20D%20gaseous,road%20vehicles). This corresponds to SAE J2719 and ISO requirements that limit key contaminants (H₂O, O₂, N₂, CO, CO₂, CH₄, sulfur compounds, etc.) to parts-per-million or lower levels to avoid poisoning the fuel cell. Type II Grade D liquid hydrogen has a similarly stringent purity but for cryogenic liquid fuel systems. Notably, such high purities are most readily achieved by electrolytic hydrogen (which is produced at high purity by default)[commercialfuelsolutions.co.uk](https://commercialfuelsolutions.co.uk/hydrogen/grade-D-gaseous-hydrogen/?srsltid=AfmBOorP-D3-6AZvG44690m-IrninFDkydgyOdHx-QXniaK_eTlaQOTF#:~:text=To%20ensure%20prolonged%20service%20life%2C,suitable%20for%20FCEV%20road%20transport). The emphasis on standards like ISO 14687 ensures that as hydrogen use expands – especially in vehicles – **interoperability and safety** are maintained.

2. **PEM Electrolyser Design**

A PEM electrolyzer consists of a solid polymer proton-conducting membrane, with electrodes (catalyst layers) on either side, operating in an acidic environment. Competing water electrolysis technologies include **alkaline electrolyzers** (which use a liquid KOH electrolyte and porous diaphragms) and **solid oxide electrolyzers (SOECs)** (which use a solid ceramic electrolyte at high temperatures ~700–800 °C to split steam). Each type has distinct advantages and drawbacks (Table 1)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Alkaline electrolyzers are a mature, commercially proven technology that can be built at multi-MW scale; they use non-noble metal catalysts (e.g. Ni-based) and inexpensive materials, giving them a cost advantage  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . However, alkaline systems have relatively low current densities (often <0.5–0.6 A/cm²) and limited partial-load range, which lead to larger cell stacks for a given output and reduced dynamic flexibility  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . They also suffer from gas crossover through the liquid electrolyte (hydrogen in the oxygen stream and vice versa), which limits the purity and poses safety risks at high pressure  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . In contrast, PEM electrolyzers can operate at much higher current densities (2 A/cm² or more, with laboratory tests exceeding 5–10 A/cm²) and have excellent dynamic response, allowing quick ramping from 0 to 100% output  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The solid polymer membrane (typically Nafion™ or similar PFSA) is gas-tight, which enables very high product hydrogen purity and the capability to output hydrogen at high pressure without significant crossover  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Indeed, some commercial PEM electrolyzers deliver hydrogen at 20–30 bar, and research models have demonstrated operation up to 350 bar  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . This _electrochemical compression_ reduces or eliminates downstream mechanical compression needs for storage  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The PEM’s ability to handle differential pressure (pressurizing only the H₂ side) also avoids having oxygen at high pressure, which improves safety (mitigating the risk of high-pressure O₂ reacting with materials like titanium)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Furthermore, PEM electrolyzers are compact and well-suited for intermittent operation tied to renewables, since they can ramp quickly and maintain efficiency across a wide load range (10–100% of rated power)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . By contrast, alkaline units have slower dynamics and often require steady operation for optimal efficiency, making PEM systems more attractive for balancing variable solar and wind power outputs  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . **SOEC** technology offers a different advantage – by running at high temperature, some of the energy input is provided as heat, potentially achieving electricity-to-hydrogen efficiencies above 100% (relative to the lower heating value of H₂)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Solid oxide electrolyzers can in theory reach very high efficiency and even use waste heat from industrial processes or nuclear reactors. However, SOECs are still at laboratory to pilot stage: they use brittle ceramic cells, face durability issues, and have not yet been commercialized at scale  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . In summary, **PEM electrolyzers** strike a balance of high performance and flexibility at the expense of higher component costs, whereas alkaline electrolyzers offer lower upfront costs but larger footprints and slower response, and SOECs promise ultimate efficiency but require further R&D to overcome stability and scale-up challenges  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . These characteristics guide the choice of electrolyzer for a given power source: e.g. PEM technology is often preferred for _solar and wind_ integration due to its rapid load-following and compact design  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 , alkaline may pair well with _steady nuclear or grid_ power if space permits, and SOEC may be ideal for _nuclear or industrial_ heat integration in the future.

**Cell Structure and MEA Design:** The fundamental unit of a PEM electrolyzer is a single electrolysis cell composed of a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) pressed between two flow-field plates (bipolar plates). The MEA typically consists of a thin proton-conducting polymer membrane (≈50–200 µm thick) coated on each side with porous catalyst layers (anode and cathode). In a state-of-the-art design, these catalyst layers are applied directly onto the membrane – a configuration called **catalyst-coated membrane (CCM)**. Alternatively, the catalyst can be applied onto a porous substrate (such as the gas diffusion layer) and then assembled against the membrane; this is known as **catalyst-coated substrate (CCS)** or decal transfer method. The CCM approach yields a more integrated interface: the catalyst layers adhere strongly to the membrane and have low contact resistance, enabling higher performance and durability  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Indeed, experiments have shown that CCM-based MEAs slightly outperform those with catalysts on the substrate, due to better interface conductivity and utilization of the catalyst  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Additional advantages of CCMs include dimensional stability and ease of handling – the membrane experiences less mechanical deformation or decoupling from electrodes during hydration/dehydration cycles, and CCM MEAs can be readily removed and replaced in stack maintenance  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . One study demonstrated continuous operation over 20,000 hours with a CCM-based PEM electrolyzer cell, highlighting the robustness of the bonded interface  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . By contrast, in early CCS designs, achieving uniform contact between separate electrode layers and the membrane was challenging, sometimes leading to higher resistance or delamination over time  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Modern MEAs for PEM electrolysis almost universally use the CCM architecture, with carefully controlled catalyst ink deposition (via spraying, screen-printing, or decal transfer) onto the membrane, followed by hot-pressing  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Scaling up MEA fabrication is an active area of research, with efforts to produce large-area CCMs (>1000 cm²) with homogenous catalyst distribution and low loadings of precious metals  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 .

On either side of the catalyst-coated membrane, a **porous transport layer** (PTL) – also called gas diffusion layer (GDL) or current collector – is placed to facilitate reactant flow, product removal, and electron conduction. In PEM fuel cells the GDL is usually a carbon fiber paper or cloth, but in PEM **electrolyzers the anode environment is highly oxidizing (O₂ at ~2 V vs. RHE)**, so corrosion-resistant **titanium** felts or sintered porous Ti are used for the PTL on the oxygen side[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=hence%2C%20carbon%20paper%2C%20which%20is,8%2C20%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=the%20first%20reason%20that%20Ti,enhance%20the%20performance%20of%20PEMWE). The cathode (hydrogen side) PTL can be carbon-based if kept at low potential, but often titanium is also used to ensure longevity, especially since any oxygen crossover could create a local fuel cell reverse-potential on the cathode carbon. The PTL must have a carefully engineered pore structure: it distributes liquid water from the flow field channels to the anode catalyst, while allowing oxygen gas bubbles to escape back to the channels[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Gas%20Diffusion%20Layer%20)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=At%20the%20cathode%2C%20liquid%20water,current%20collectors%20at%20the%20anode). At the cathode, the PTL/GDL provides pathways for hydrogen gas to exit and for excess water (if any) to be removed[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=At%20the%20anode%2C%20the%20liquid,collector%20into%20the%20flow%20passages)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=At%20the%20cathode%2C%20liquid%20water,current%20collectors%20at%20the%20anode). It also conducts electrons from the cathode catalyst layer to the bipolar plate. Because the anode PTL is often made of titanium (to resist corrosion), its surface may form a thin oxide that increases contact resistance over time[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Titanium%20is%20generally%20considered%20the,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance). To mitigate this, manufacturers often coat the Ti PTL or bipolar plate with noble metals (e.g. a thin layer of gold or platinum) to preserve low interfacial resistance[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Titanium%20is%20generally%20considered%20the,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=excellent%20strength%2C%20low%20resistivity%2C%20high,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance). Research is ongoing into advanced coatings and treatments (e.g. iridium oxide deposition on PTLs) to stabilize the interface without using excessive noble metal[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Schematic-illustration-of-the-key-components-inside-a-PEM-electrolyzer-b-Ir-coated_fig2_350608545#:~:text=,)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Schematic-illustration-of-the-key-components-inside-a-PEM-electrolyzer-b-Ir-coated_fig2_350608545#:~:text=the%20anode%27s%20electrode%2C%20conduct%20electrons%2C,PTLs%20will%20be%20investigated.). The PTL design (felt vs. sintered powder vs. mesh) and its thickness can significantly impact performance; thinner PTLs reduce ohmic drop and improve mass transport, but too thin a PTL might have inhomogeneous contact with the catalyst layer[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=the%20first%20reason%20that%20Ti,8%2C20%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=diffusion%20layers%20%28TT,8%2C20%5D.). For example, studies show that a thinner Ti felt (~350 µm) yields lower resistance than a thick one (1 mm) in PEM cells, improving voltage efficiency[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=hence%2C%20carbon%20paper%2C%20which%20is,8%2C20%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=the%20first%20reason%20that%20Ti,enhance%20the%20performance%20of%20PEMWE). Overall, the MEA – comprising membrane, catalyst layers, and PTLs – is the heart of the PEM electrolyzer, where water electrolysis occurs as per the reactions: at the anode, 2 H₂O → O₂ + 4 H⁺ + 4 e⁻; at the cathode, 4 H⁺ + 4 e⁻ → 2 H₂.

**Membrane Materials – PFSA vs. Hydrocarbon vs. Composites:** The polymer electrolyte membrane in PEM electrolyzers not only conducts protons but also serves as the gas separator between H₂ and O₂. The incumbent membrane material is a **perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)** ionomer, exemplified by Nafion (developed by DuPont). PFSAs have high proton conductivity (on the order of 0.1 S/cm when fully hydrated at 80 °C) and excellent chemical stability in the harsh oxidative environment @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Their mechanical toughness and long track record in PEM fuel cells made them a natural choice for electrolyzers as well @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . However, PFSA membranes have notable drawbacks: _cost and environmental impact_, and _gas permeability_. The fluorinated polymer is expensive to produce and raises end-of-life disposal concerns (fluorine-containing polymers require special handling) @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Moreover, Nafion and similar PFSAs exhibit significant hydrogen crossover – the diffusion of H₂ through the membrane – especially at higher temperature or thinner membrane thickness @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Hydrogen permeation through PFSA can be problematic when operating at high pressure or differential pressure: if too much H₂ diffuses to the O₂ side, it can approach the flammability limit (~4% H₂ in O₂) and trigger safety shutdowns @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . In practice, to keep H₂ in O₂ below that threshold, PEM systems either use thicker membranes (>100 µm Nafion) or include catalytic recombiners to eliminate leaked hydrogen – but both solutions reduce efficiency or add complexity @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . These issues have prompted research into **hydrocarbon-based membranes** (non-fluorinated polymers). Hydrocarbon proton exchange membranes (such as sulfonated polyarylene ethers, polyetherketones, or polyphenylene sulfones) generally have lower gas permeability than PFSA because of their tighter polymer morphology @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . They also can be cheaper and have a smaller environmental footprint (no fluorine). Early skepticism about hydrocarbon membranes in fuel cells stemmed from their lower chemical stability under radical attack and sometimes lower conductivity at equivalent thickness. However, for PEM electrolyzers, the appeal of hydrocarbon membranes is strong: they can dramatically cut hydrogen crossover (studies report 2–3× lower H₂ permeation) while maintaining similar proton conductivity when fully hydrated @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . They also often tolerate higher operating temperatures (>80 °C) without degrading, potentially improving kinetics and heat rejection @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Recent breakthroughs have shown that all-hydrocarbon MEAs can meet or even exceed Nafion performance. Klose _et al._ (2020) demonstrated a PEM electrolyzer MEA using a sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) (sPPS) membrane that achieved 3.5 A/cm² at 1.8 V – more than double the current density of a Nafion 115 baseline MEA (~1.5 A/cm² at 1.8 V) @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . The hydrocarbon membrane MEA had ~threefold lower high-frequency resistance and one-third the H₂ crossover of Nafion, enabling both higher efficiency and inherent safety margins @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . This study and others underscore that hydrocarbon membranes, if properly engineered, can reduce one of PEM technology’s key failure modes (gas mixing) without sacrificing performance. The remaining challenge is ensuring long-term chemical stability; researchers have been developing reinforced or chemically stabilized hydrocarbon membranes and exploring additives (e.g. radical scavengers) to extend lifetime in hot, O₂-rich conditions. Another approach is **composite membranes**, which combine a PFSA with a porous or inert backbone to reduce swelling and crossover. For example, adding inorganic fillers (like silica, zirconia, or graphene oxide) to Nafion can lower its gas permeability by filling voids, albeit sometimes at the cost of slightly lower conductivity  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Reinforced membranes (e.g. expanded PTFE-reinforced Nafion) are used in some commercial electrolyzers to improve mechanical strength, allowing thinner membranes that still resist pinhole formation and hydrogen leaks. In summary, membrane development is a critical area for PEM electrolyzer improvement: the ideal membrane would be thin (for low resistance), highly proton-conductive, impermeable to gases, durable in hot acidic oxygen, and low-cost. Advances in hydrocarbon and composite membranes are actively moving the field toward these goals @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 .

**Electrocatalysts – HER and OER:** PEM water electrolysis requires efficient catalysts at both electrodes: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. The HER in acidic media is relatively fast and can be catalyzed by platinum-based materials with low overpotential. Indeed, PEM electrolyzer cathodes typically use **Pt/C** (platinum on carbon support) or platinum black, with loadings on the order of 0.1–0.5 mg_Pt/cm² (much lower than in fuel cell anodes, because hydrogen evolution is less demanding than oxygen reduction or evolution). The OER, however, is notoriously slow and demanding: it involves a four-electron transfer and the formation of oxygen-oxygen bonds, which on most materials requires a high overpotential. Moreover, at ~1.8–2.0 V vs. RHE, the anode environment is highly oxidative. The state-of-the-art OER catalyst in PEM systems is **iridium oxide (IrO₂)** or iridium mixed oxides (IrO₂ doped with ruthenium or other elements)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . IrO₂ offers a balance of reasonable activity and adequate stability. **Ruthenium oxide (RuO₂)** actually has higher intrinsic OER activity (lower overpotential)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 , but pure RuO₂ anodes corrode rapidly in acidic OER conditions, leading to short life  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Studies in the 1970s–80s established the activity trends for OER and HER catalysts: e.g. Burke and Moynihan showed that, among single metals, the OER activity (at 80 °C in acid) follows the order Ir ≈ Ru > Pd > Rh > Pt > Au  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Similarly, for the HER the order was Pd > Pt > Rh > Ir > … > Ni (with palladium and platinum being the best pure metals for H⁺ reduction)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . These findings explain the choice of Pt and Ir as the primary electrocatalysts. Modern PEM anodes often use iridium in oxide form (IrO₂ or Ir black which forms IrO₂ in situ) with loadings ~1–2 mg_Ir/cm². Even at those loadings, iridium’s scarcity is a serious concern: Ir is roughly 10–40× less abundant than platinum in Earth’s crust  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 , and its price has climbed in recent years. Thus, a major thrust in R&D is to **reduce Ir usage**. Approaches include developing high-surface-area IrO₂ nanoparticles or nano-porous iridium that have higher mass activity, alloying Ir with more abundant elements (e.g. Ir–Ni or Ir–W mixed oxides) to dilute the Ir content, or finding alternative OER catalysts. Some alternative catalysts under investigation are crystalline mixed oxides like pyrochlores (e.g. Pb₂Ir₂O₇₋ₓ), perovskites (SrRuO₃, etc.), or novel formulations like transition metal phosphides or nitrides. However, **no completely platinum-group-metal-free catalyst** has yet demonstrated both high OER activity and sufficient stability in the PEM electrolyzer environment. Non-noble candidates (e.g. manganese or cobalt oxides) tend to dissolve in acidic electrolyte under OER conditions. Researchers are exploring protective coatings or self-healing concepts (e.g. a sacrificial buffer layer that releases ions to keep the catalyst stable), but these are in early stages. On the HER side, there is some progress in PGM-free catalysts: for example, molybdenum sulfides and tungsten carbide materials have shown HER activity in acid, but their stability is also an issue. Given that the cathode Pt loading is already low and contributes minimally to cost, the focus remains on the anode. One promising avenue is to deploy ultra-low Ir loadings by exploiting advanced supports: Wang _et al._ note that efforts in catalyst development include novel support materials that increase utilization of Ir and investigations into catalysts like crystalline IrRuOx or metastable phase oxides that might achieve higher activity per mass of Ir  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Also, the DOE “ElectroCat” program has targeted PGM-free catalysts for low-temperature electrolyzers @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction , though mainly for anion-exchange membrane (AEM) systems where the alkaline environment permits non-noble metals. Another degradation mechanism for catalysts is **dissolution and Ostwald ripening**: under repeated on/off or dynamic conditions, Ir can dissolve as Ir⁴⁺ and redeposit, causing loss of active surface area. Mitigating this involves operating protocols (avoid high OER potentials beyond needed) and materials choices (Ir in a stable oxide form, or adding SnO₂ or Ta₂O₅ as stabilizers). In sum, today’s PEM electrolyzer catalysts are typically Pt/C at the cathode and IrO₂ at the anode; these deliver excellent performance (often total cell overpotential of only ~0.3–0.4 V at 1 A/cm² beyond the thermodynamic 1.229 V  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 ), but their high cost and limited availability drive substantial research into catalyst optimization. A key research goal is to achieve the same performance with perhaps 5–10× less Ir – or to find a breakthrough replacement – to enable scaling to the terawatt levels of hydrogen production envisioned for mid-century  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 .

**Bipolar Plates and Flow Fields:** The bipolar plate (BPP) in a PEM electrolyzer serves as both the anode of one cell and the cathode of the next cell in a series stack (hence “bipolar”). It provides structural support, separates gases between cells, conducts electrical current, and incorporates flow channels to distribute water and collect gases. Bipolar plates are commonly made of **titanium** in PEM water electrolyzers due to titanium’s corrosion resistance in acidic, oxygen-rich conditions[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Titanium%20is%20generally%20considered%20the,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=excellent%20strength%2C%20low%20resistivity%2C%20high,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance). (In contrast, PEM fuel cell BPPs are often stainless steel or graphite composite, but those would corrode and contaminate the membrane in an electrolyzer anode.) Even titanium requires surface treatments (like passivation or noble metal coating) to prevent growth of resistive oxide layers over thousands of hours[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Titanium%20is%20generally%20considered%20the,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=excellent%20strength%2C%20low%20resistivity%2C%20high,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance). The design of the **flow field** etched or formed on the bipolar plate is crucial for performance. Several flow field patterns are used: **parallel channels**, **single-serpentine** (a single long channel that winds across the plate), **multiple serpentine** (several shorter serpentine paths in parallel), **grid/mesh** patterns, and **pin-hole** or porous distributor plates @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . Each has pros and cons. _Parallel_ channels offer low pressure drop, which is advantageous for pumping efficiency, but can suffer from uneven flow distribution – some areas may starve of water or accumulate gas if flow is not uniform @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . _Serpentine_ channels force the flow through a longer path, ensuring all areas see flow and helping to carry away gas bubbles, but at the cost of higher pressure drop and pumping power @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . Multi-serpentine designs attempt to balance distribution and pressure. In PEM **fuel cells**, serpentine and interdigitated flows are common to manage liquid water removal, whereas in **electrolyzers**, managing gas (oxygen) removal from the anode is the key challenge (the cathode hydrogen is usually less volumetric since 1 H₂ vs 0.5 O₂ per water). Research has shown that in PEM electrolyzers, typical flow field configurations include parallel, single or multi-serpentine, and even **porous media flow-fields** @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . A porous flow field (for example, a sintered metal foam or a fine metallic mesh covering the entire area) can act as both flow distributor and current feeder @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . The Toyota Mirai fuel cell (PEMFC) notably uses a 3D porous metal mesh flow field, which inspired similar approaches in electrolyzers to enhance uniformity @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . The advantage of a porous flow field is that it provides a multitude of paths for fluids, improving distribution and reducing stagnant zones; it also eliminates the “land/channel” pattern of conventional fields, possibly reducing local hotspots or dry spots @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . However, porous flow fields tend to impose a higher flow resistance across the entire area (since fluid percolates through tiny pores), meaning higher pumping energy and careful design to avoid large pressure differences @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . For example, experiments show improved mass transport and higher limiting current densities with porous flow distributors, at the expense of some increase in pressure drop @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . In any design, an important aspect is removing oxygen bubbles from the anode catalyst layer and PTL. Two-phase flow in the channels can be mist/film flow or slug flow depending on the rate @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . If large bubbles get trapped, they can block active area. That’s why serpentine channels (which “push” bubbles out with convective force) or angled outlet manifolds are often used to assist gas evacuation. In high-pressure systems, bubble removal is even more critical due to gas density. Summarily, modern PEM electrolyzer stacks often use machined titanium bipolar plates with either parallel or serpentine channels on the anode and cathode. There is a trend toward **integrating the flow field with the PTL** – for instance, using a stamped expanded metal that acts as both current collector and flow distributor (simplifying the stack and reducing parts) @wangPEMFuelCell2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . Additive manufacturing has also been explored for complex bipolar plate geometries (e.g. flow fields with internal cooling or novel 3D patterns)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/e-Design-of-bipolar-plate-a-front-side-of-bipolar-plate-b-backside-of-bipolar-plate_fig2_273317519#:~:text=e%20Design%20of%20bipolar%20plate%3A,restraining%20mass%20transfer%20resistance)[sciopen.com](https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.26599/NRE.2022.9120032#:~:text=Status%20and%20perspectives%20of%20key,Hydrogen). The overall goals are to ensure uniform water delivery, efficient oxygen removal, low electrical and fluidic losses, and robust long-term behavior.

**Failure Mechanisms and Durability:** Key failure and degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers include membrane degradation, catalyst degradation, gas crossover, and component corrosion. The **membrane** can degrade via chemical attack (radical species like •OH or •OOH generated by trace impurities or by catalyst interactions can attack the polymer) and mechanical stress (swelling/shrinking during wet-dry cycles or differential pressure stress)  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Over time, membranes can develop **pinhole leaks** or cracks that dramatically increase H₂/O₂ crossover. Once a pinhole forms, the cell often must be shut down because the product gases begin to mix. To mitigate this, thicker membranes or reinforced membranes are used, but at the cost of higher ohmic resistance  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . As noted earlier, using hydrocarbon membranes or composite structures can lower gas crossover, delaying this failure mode @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Nonetheless, even the best membranes will eventually suffer some degradation after thousands of hours, so understanding the end-of-life (EOL) criteria (e.g. 4% H₂ in O₂ or a certain leakage current density) is crucial. **Gas crossover** itself is a silent degradation issue: even if it doesn’t reach flammability, permeated H₂ to the anode causes a loss of Faradaic efficiency (some H₂ is wasted), and permeated O₂ to the cathode can poison the catalyst or cause undesirable reverse reactions. Crossover increases exponentially with membrane thinning and also with pressure differential  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Thus, operating at very high pressure or using ultrathin membranes requires careful design (recombination catalysts embedded in frames, etc.). A typical safety measure is adding **recombination catalyst** (often a small Pt/Pd catalyst) on the oxygen side to catalytically burn off any diffused H₂ into water, maintaining H₂-in-O₂ below the LFL of 4%  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . This adds complexity and cost, however, and also consumes some product gas.

The **catalysts** can degrade primarily by _dissolution_ and _coarsening_. At the OER anode, Ir dissolves slightly in the form of Ir ions, especially if the potential exceeds certain thresholds or during shutdowns when transient high potentials can occur. Lost Ir can redeposit as inactive agglomerates or even migrate and plate elsewhere (sometimes observed on membranes or cathodes). This leads to loss of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) over time, raising the cell voltage for the same current. Mitigation strategies include keeping the cell polarized (to avoid open-circuit which can create mixed potentials driving dissolution), using IrOx in a crystalline form that is less soluble, or adding stable oxides (TiO₂, SnO₂) as supports that anchor IrO₂ and reduce its dissolution. At the cathode, Pt degradation is less severe in an electrolyzer than in a fuel cell (because the cathode is at low potential ~0 V vs RHE during operation). However, during shutdown or potential reversal, the cathode can see high potentials and oxidize Pt. Additionally, any oxygen crossover can create a local fuel cell action that corrodes the carbon support or dissolves Pt. Thus, some designs even avoid carbon supports on the cathode, using pure Pt black or alternative supports to ensure stability. **Bipolar plate corrosion** is another concern: titanium is very resilient, but if cheaper materials (like stainless steel with protective coatings) are used to reduce cost, any pinholes or coating failures can lead to metal corrosion, contamination of the membrane (with metal ions like Fe²⁺ which can produce radical attacks on the membrane), and increased resistance. Ensuring long-term stability of coatings (for example, TiN or conductive oxides on stainless steel) is an active area of development.

From a **durability standpoint**, PEM electrolyzers have already demonstrated impressive lifetimes in testing, but further improvement is needed for widespread adoption. Continuous operation of over 40,000 hours (~5 years) has been reported for some PEM systems, and DOE has set targets of **80,000 hour stack lifetime** (about 9 years) by 2026 for PEM electrolyzers @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction  @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction  – akin to the lifetimes desired for stationary fuel cells. Achieving this will require minimizing all the above degradation factors. Water purity is also critical: ionic impurities can migrate and cause local hot spots or membrane degradation (e.g. chloride traces can cause pitting corrosion of anode components and attack Nafion). Therefore, deionized water supply and periodic water conditioning are part of system maintenance. Temperature control is another factor – higher temperatures improve performance but can accelerate membrane and catalyst aging. Many current PEM electrolyzers operate around 50–80 °C; pushing to 90 °C or more will demand more robust materials or accept shorter life. On the other hand, operating at lower temperature (say 50 °C) can extend life but at the cost of efficiency due to higher resistance. There is a delicate balance in the design and operating strategy to maximize both efficiency and durability.

**Notable Experimental Validations:** Since General Electric’s pioneering work in the 1960s–70s (when the concept of PEM electrolysis was first demonstrated), tremendous progress has been made in performance. Early PEM electrolyzers at GE already achieved ≈1.9 V at 1 A/cm² and ran for over 15,000 h without major degradation  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 , albeit using very high loadings of platinum and iridium catalysts by today’s standards. Those experiments presciently mentioned “future hydrogen economy” and the need to reduce catalyst loading for cost – issues still relevant today  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . In recent years, several record-setting tests have been reported. As mentioned, Klose _et al._ (2020) demonstrated >3 A/cm² at 1.8 V using a novel hydrocarbon membrane MEA @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 , indicating the possibility of higher current density (hence more hydrogen output per cell area) with new materials. The EU project NEPTUNE in 2019 tested a PEM electrolyzer cell at up to 6 A/cm² under transient operation, exploring the envelope of dynamic response. On the system level, **large PEM electrolyzer deployments** serve as proofs of concept: a 6 MW PEM electrolyzer plant (Cummins/NEL) has been operating in Canada since 2019; a 10 MW Siemens PEM electrolyzer was installed at a refinery in Germany, producing H₂ for fuel and chemicals[discovery.ucl.ac.uk](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10140633/3/Maier_ReviewMassTransportPEMWE_Reviewed_Unmarked.pdf#:~:text=The%20most%20widely%20applied%20and,11); and a 20 MW PEM system by ITM Power in the UK is providing grid-balancing services while generating hydrogen for industrial use. Such deployments validate the scalability and integration of PEM technology. They have shown that multi-MW systems can operate efficiently (system efficiencies of ~55–70% HHV, i.e. 50–60 kWh/kg H₂) and handle renewable power inputs. For example, Hydrogenics (Cummins) reported their 20 MW electrolyzer at Becancour can follow demand and ramp in seconds, confirming the PEM’s suitability for grid regulation. Another experimental milestone is the operation of PEM electrolyzers at high pressure: Giner ELX demonstrated a PEM stack producing hydrogen at 350 bar directly (for fueling applications), and although efficiency drops at such pressure, it proved the concept of high-pressure electrolysis  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Additionally, durability demonstrations have been encouraging – lifetimes beyond 60,000 hours have been projected by extrapolating current degradation rates (which are often on the order of microvolts per hour). Research efforts like the DOE’s H2NEW consortium are conducting rigorous stack testing to identify failure modes and improve longevity. In sum, the PEM electrolyzer has evolved from laboratory curiosities to mature systems: single-cell performance has roughly doubled in current density over the past decade @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 , and scale has increased by orders of magnitude (from 100 kW pilots to >10 MW plants). The design innovations – advanced membranes, optimized flow fields, durable catalysts, and robust MEAs – underpin this progress and are continually refined to meet the technoeconomic challenges discussed next.

Technoeconomic Analysis


**Strategies for Cost Reduction:** There are several parallel strategies to drive down the cost of PEM electrolytic hydrogen:

- **Manufacturing Scale-Up and Automation:** Moving from bespoke or low-volume production to automated, high-volume manufacturing will cut costs significantly. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated that design standardization, gigawatt-scale factories, and learning-by-doing could reduce electrolyzer capital costs by ~40% in the short term (to 2025) and up to 80% in the long term (by 2050) @GreenHydrogenCost2020  @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . These reductions come from improved labor efficiency, bulk materials purchasing, and improved yields. For example, building many more stacks will encourage development of specialized production lines for MEA fabrication (maybe roll-to-roll coating of catalyst on membrane), which can drastically lower unit costs. Larger plant sizes also spread the balance-of-plant costs (rectifiers, piping, control systems) over more capacity. Pivovar _et al._ present a “waterfall” chart analysis breaking down PEM stack cost – showing pathways from a current ~$350/kW (stack-only cost at high volume) to ~$200/kW and ultimately $100/kW @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021  @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021 . Achieving $100/kW likely requires both _R&D breakthroughs_ (like higher performance, enabling fewer cells and lower precious metal per kW) and _manufacturing scale_ (to reduce overheads and material costs) @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021  @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021 . For instance, increasing operating current density directly reduces required active area for a given hydrogen output, shrinking the stack size and material usage. If membranes can handle 4 A/cm² instead of 2 A/cm² at similar efficiency, you need half the area (thus roughly half the bipolar plates, gaskets, etc., per kg H₂). In the Pivovar analysis, major cost savings came from increased current density, reduced PGM catalyst loading, cheaper bipolar plate production, and cheaper assembly – all enabled by materials improvements and scale manufacturing @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021  @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021 .
    
- **Performance Improvements:** As noted, enhancing the performance (efficiency and current density) of the electrolyzer lowers both capital-related costs and electricity consumption per kg H₂. Higher efficiency (lower cell voltage at a given current) means fewer kWh per kg, directly cutting the energy cost portion. The DOE and EU targets aim for cell efficiencies ~77% HHV (which is ~1.60 V per cell at moderate current density) by 2030, compared to ~60–65% HHV (1.8–2.0 V) typical today @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction  @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction . This will require better catalysts and membranes to reduce overpotentials and resistances. Meanwhile, pushing current density higher allows more hydrogen production from the same stack hardware. Some advanced PEM prototypes operate at 4–5 A/cm² in short bursts, but doing so continuously may require stronger water flow and raises concerns of mass transport losses. R&D on new flow field designs and thinner diffusion layers (as discussed) addresses these issues. A related aspect is operating pressure – high-pressure operation can save on compression cost but slightly increases cell voltage due to thermodynamics and mass transport  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The technoeconomic balance between an electrolyzer producing at low pressure plus an external compressor vs. producing at high pressure directly is complex; studies have shown only modest net efficiency loss for moderate pressure (e.g. 30 bar) operation  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 , and when accounting for avoided compressor capital, high-pressure PEM electrolysis can be beneficial  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Many current systems compromise by producing H₂ at ~30 bar, which is a good trade-off for storage in tanks at 100–200 bar (the subsequent compression is easier than from 1 bar).
    
- **Catalyst and Material Cost Reduction:** Since precious metals (Ir, Pt) are significant contributors to stack cost, reducing their loading or finding alternatives is a key strategy. If Ir loading per unit can be cut by e.g. 4× (through higher utilization or new catalysts), that directly reduces catalyst cost by 75%. There are encouraging results where advanced IrO₂ catalysts on high-surface supports achieve equal performance with, say, 0.3 mg/cm² Ir compared to a conventional 1.5–2 mg/cm² @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . In one approach, researchers developed ultrafine Ir nanoparticles dispersed on a TaC support, retaining activity with one-fifth the Ir of standard electrodes; however, long-term stability remains to be proven. As mentioned, hydrocarbon membranes could eliminate the need for very thick Nafion (which itself is expensive) or recombination catalysts, indirectly saving cost and complexity @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Also, if PGM-free cathode catalysts become viable, Pt could be eliminated (though Pt is a relatively small cost portion, often <$0.20/kg H₂). Bipolar plate materials are another target: replacing massive titanium plates with cheaper alloys or even molded carbon composites could slash costs – if durability challenges can be solved. Additive manufacturing of thinner or functionally integrated plates might also reduce material usage[docs.nrel.gov](https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/87625.pdf#:~:text=,Taner%2C%20Naqvi%2C%20and%20Ozkaymak)[sciopen.com](https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.26599/NRE.2022.9120032#:~:text=Status%20and%20perspectives%20of%20key,Hydrogen).
    
- **Scaling and Learning Effects:** Historically, technologies like solar PV and batteries have seen steep cost declines (~20% cost reduction for each doubling of cumulative production, known as Wright’s law or experience curves). Electrolyzers, being at an early stage, could follow a similar trajectory. Empirically, the Alkaline electrolyzer cost declined somewhat in the 2010s with more MW-scale deployments, and PEM is expected to follow. Analysts project that with tens of GW deployed by 2030, factory-built PEM electrolyzers could approach the $200/kW system cost level @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021  @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021 . Government programs such as the U.S. DOE’s H2NEW consortium and EU’s Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on hydrogen are funding pilot manufacturing lines to drive this learning. The ultimate vision is mass-produced electrolyzer modules (like how wind turbines or solar panels are made today) that can be installed in large numbers at wind/solar farms or industrial sites. If realized, this mass production could unlock very low costs and allow hydrogen to be produced at **<$2/kg by 2030** in regions with cheap renewable electricity @GreenHydrogenCost2020  @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . Indeed, IRENA’s analysis suggests green hydrogen costs could fall below $2/kg within this decade in optimal conditions, and potentially **below $1/kg** in the longer term (2040s) with simultaneous cheap power and cheap electrolyzers @GreenHydrogenCost2020  @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . That would make green H₂ competitive with fossil fuels on a per-BTU basis in many markets, unleashing vast demand.


**Cost Analysis Frameworks:** Researchers and analysts use various frameworks to evaluate hydrogen production economics. One common tool is the DOE’s **H2A (Hydrogen Analysis) model**, which is a publicly available discounted cash flow model tailored for hydrogen technologies@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014. H2A provides a standardized way to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen ($/kg) given inputs like capital cost, efficiency, feedstock cost, capacity factor, financing, and plant life. It ensures consistent assumptions (e.g. a specified internal rate of return, depreciation, etc.) so that different production pathways (electrolysis, SMR, biomass gasification, etc.) can be compared on an even basis@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014. For example, H2A was used in a 2014 DOE study by Colella _et al._ to compare PEM electrolysis at “forecourt” scale (distributed, 1,500 kg H₂/day) and “central” scale (50,000 kg/day) for current technology vs. projected future improvements@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014. That study identified the high capital cost and low capacity factor of forecourt electrolysis as key hurdles and noted that only with future cost reductions and cheap electricity could PEM electrolysis meet the DOE target of $2–4 per gge (untaxed) hydrogen@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014. Besides H2A, other frameworks include **levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH)** calculations akin to levelized cost of energy, and more sophisticated **optimization models** that consider operating strategies. For instance, models have been developed to optimize electrolyzer operation against time-of-day electricity prices – essentially a **techno-economic optimization** to minimize $/kg by deciding when to run the electrolyzer (this is relevant for grid-integrated projects). There are also **learning curve models** projecting how costs fall with cumulative capacity. Such models fed into the Hydrogen Council roadmap, which posited up to 60% cost decline in the 2030 timeframe with aggressive scale-up.

Current cost models provide valuable insights but also have limitations. Traditional H2A-style analyses assume a relatively steady operating profile and often base inputs on today’s costs or optimistic future estimates. One critique is that many TEA studies assume high capacity factors (e.g. electrolyzer running 90% of the time) to drive down hydrogen cost, whereas if paired with intermittent renewables without grid backup, the capacity factor may be much lower (solar-only electrolysis might run ~20–25% of hours). Running at lower utilization increases hydrogen unit cost unless capital is very cheap or surplus electricity is virtually free. Some models now incorporate the cost of **energy storage or grid connection** to boost utilization – for example, including a battery or allowing grid electricity at times to supplement renewables. Another consideration often simplified is **degradation and replacement**: in LCOH models, one usually includes a stack replacement cost at a certain interval (e.g. every 7 years). However, degradation is a continuous process and can also increase operating power needs over time. Few models fully integrate performance degradation into the cost calculation (though some studies do sensitivity analyses on lifetime). Additionally, by focusing on levelized cost, analysts might under-appreciate **market mechanisms and revenue streams**. For instance, electrolyzers could provide grid services (frequency regulation, load balancing), earning revenue that offsets hydrogen costs – a factor beyond simple LCOH. Some recent research integrates these revenue streams into project economics, effectively reducing net hydrogen costs by a few percent @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024  @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 .

It’s also noted that some cost studies use historically low renewable prices and assume they can be fully dedicated to H₂ production. While renewable PPA prices have dropped dramatically (wind and solar < $20/MWh in best cases @GreenHydrogenCost2020 ), the reality of procuring large volumes of such low-cost electricity for electrolysis may involve additional grid costs or variability. Models that assume constant $20/MWh power may be oversimplified; a more realistic modeling might use hourly price distributions or a mix of solar and wind profiles. The new IRS rules (additionality, hourly matching) effectively force such granular accounting, which will influence future TEAs – a recent analysis by Resources for the Future found that strict hourly matching could increase hydrogen costs by 5–25% compared to annual matching, due to needing either oversized renewables or more expensive storage to cover lulls[gtlaw.com](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/1/treasury-issues-final-guidance-on-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit#:~:text=,allowed%20until%202030%2C%20with)[powereng.com](https://www.powereng.com/library/treasury-department-and-irs-release-45v-clean-hydrogen-rule/#:~:text=Rule%20www,challenging%20for%20some%20producers).

**Gaps and Opportunities in Current Literature:** The technoeconomic literature on PEM electrolysis is growing, but there are gaps. One gap is real-world data from existing projects – many models rely on projections and vendor quotes, but as more 10+ MW projects come online, empirical performance and cost data should be fed back into analyses. There’s an opportunity for studies on **learning rates** specific to electrolyzers: how quickly will costs fall as manufacturing scales? AEM electrolyzers (anion exchange membrane) are an emerging low-cost alternative (they can use non-PGM catalysts and cheaper construction). If AEM technology matures, it could drastically change cost projections, but few TEA studies so far include AEM pathways – this is an opportunity area for analysis. Another gap is the **system-level integration cost**: electrolyzer cost models often exclude the cost of integrating with renewables (transmission, firming capacity, etc.). For truly green hydrogen, one must sometimes overbuild renewables or include energy storage, and those costs need to be considered. Some recent work (e.g. Glenk & Reichelstein 2019) looked at niche applications where electrolysis with renewables can already be cost-competitive (like power-to-gas utilizing otherwise curtailed energy) @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024  @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . However, the literature could further explore the interplay of carbon pricing, renewables curtailment, and electrolyzer economics. With carbon prices or credits like 45V, the effective cost of green H₂ to a producer can be negative (a subsidy) up to the credit value – but that requires compliance with those rules, which adds operational constraints.

Finally, there is an opportunity in technoeconomic optimization of electrolyzer **stack design vs. operating strategy**. For instance, a more expensive, durable stack might economically allow a flexible low-capacity-factor operation (using only cheap electricity), whereas a cheaper but less robust stack might need steady operation. The current literature seldom links design parameters (membrane thickness, catalyst loading, etc.) to economic outcomes explicitly. Developing multi-physics TEA models that co-optimize performance and cost could guide R&D – e.g., is it worth doubling catalyst to gain efficiency? At what iridium price does that trade-off flip? Such questions are vital as materials like Ir become constraints.

Hydrogen economy and policies

## 1. Hydrogen economy and Policy Landscape

Hydrogen has become a pivotal energy carrier in global decarbonization strategies.  Before the end of 2019, only five countries had issued national hydrogen strategies, but a year later, nearly 20 countries had released plans (with at least 10 more forthcoming), and the industry had announced ~25 GW of electrolyzer capacity for green hydrogen by 2026 @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . In the European Union, hydrogen features prominently in climate initiatives (e.g., the "Fit for 55" package and REPowerEU plan) with targets for tens of gigawatts of electrolyzers by 2030, alongside regulations to define renewable hydrogen. The United States, through the Department of Energy's "Hydrogen Shot," aims for agenda "$1 for 1 kg in 1 decade," i.e., $1/kg H₂ by 2031 @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021  , @doeHydrogenShot2020 . The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act created a new Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit up to $3/kg for hydrogen produced with a life-cycle carbon intensity <0.45 kg CO₂e per kg H₂ @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . Additionally, projects can opt for a 30% investment tax credit in lieu of the production credit if they commence construction by 2033 and meet labor standards @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . Such incentives, alongside $8 billion appropriated for at least four regional clean hydrogen hubs (now expanded to seven hubs) @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 , signal robust U.S. federal support to accelerate a low-cost, clean hydrogen economy.
A critical regulatory development around green hydrogen is the definition of criteria for incrementality, deliverability, and temporal matching of renewable power. These principles are intended to ensure that electrolytic hydrogen credited as "clean" is truly powered by new, clean energy sources rather than diverting existing generation @45VHydrogenTax , @45VHydrogenTaxa, @Section45VClean , @GuidelinesDetermineWellGate2024 . The U.S. Treasury's proposed rules for 45V (and the finalized guidance in 2024) included three pillars for grid-connected electrolyzers using renewable electricity: (i) Incrementality – the renewable power source must be new or incremental (generally in operation ≤36 months before the H₂ facility; (ii) **Temporal matching** – the hydrogen production must be matched in time with renewable generation (hourly matching to be required by 2030); and (iii) Geographical deliverability – the renewable source must be located in the same region or electrically deliverable to the electrolyzer @45VHydrogenTax , @45VHydrogenTaxa , @Section45VClean , @GuidelinesDetermineWellGate2024 . In other words, projects claiming the credit via grid power need to procure Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) from new renewable plants, ensure those EACs correspond to the same hour of H₂ production, and source power from the same or an adjacent grid region. These requirements are designed to guarantee that "clean" hydrogen production truly adds renewable energy to the system and minimizes associated CO₂. The EU has pursued a similar approach in its Delegated Act on Renewable Hydrogen, emphasizing the additionality of renewables and temporal and geographic correlation for grid-supplied electricity @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 .

Over 95% of global hydrogen (approximately 70–90 million tonnes annually) is produced via steam methane reforming of natural gas or coal gasification, processes that emit large volumes of CO₂  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  , @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . This status quo yields cheap hydrogen (often $1–2/kg) but negates climate goals. Transitioning to green hydrogen (from electrolysis with renewable power) or even lower-carbon **"blue" hydrogen** (from fossil fuels with carbon capture) will require massive investment and policy support @GreenHydrogenCost2020 , @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . The cost of green hydrogen currently averages 2–3 times higher than blue hydrogen; for example, fossil-based H₂ can cost $1–3/kg, whereas electrolytic hydrogen using low-carbon electricity is about $3.5–7.5/kg under current costs @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . This gap is primarily because electricity input dominates production cost – roughly 50–60% of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) – making green H₂ very sensitive to power prices @GreenHydrogenCost2020  @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . High capital costs of electrolyzers are the second major factor @GreenHydrogenCost2020 .
The unsustainability and instability of the hydrogen economy arise in that without significant cost reductions, clean hydrogen cannot easily compete with grey hydrogen @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 . PEM electrolyzers rely on scarce iridium (for catalysts) and gallium/platinum-coated components, and a rapid scale-up in PEM deployment could strain the supply or drive up prices of these critical materials  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . For instance, iridium is one of the rarest elements in Earth's crust (~0.001 ppm), and wider adoption of PEM electrolysis would significantly increase global Ir demand, risking price escalation  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . This supply risk underscores the importance of R&D in substituting noble metals in electrolyzers. Projections for a green hydrogen economy remain optimistic despite these challenges   @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 .  Recent data from the International Energy Agency's Hydrogen Projects Database documented 1,219 hydrogen projects worldwide slated for commissioning between 2020 and 2030 @nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024 .
Hydrogen is often classified by a color taxonomy, which denotes production method and carbon footprint. 
[image for colors of hydrogen]
![[image-65.png]]
Green hydrogen refers to H₂ produced via water electrolysis powered by renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, etc.), yielding zero direct CO₂ emissions @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . Grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuels without emissions mitigation (e.g., natural gas reforming or coal gasification releasing CO₂ to the air) @GreenHydrogenCost2020 . Blue hydrogen is similarly fossil-derived but with carbon capture and storage applied to reduce net CO₂ emissions. "Blue" is considered a lower-carbon interim solution, though its life-cycle emissions depend on capture efficiency and methane leakage. Brown/black hydrogen typically refers to hydrogen from coal (brown for lignite, black for bituminous) without CCS, which has the highest CO₂ emissions. Pink (or purple) hydrogen denotes hydrogen produced by electrolysis powered by nuclear energy (zero-carbon electricity that is not renewable). There are also terms like "turquoise" hydrogen for hydrogen from methane pyrolysis (splitting natural gas into H₂ and solid carbon) and "white" hydrogen for the rare case of naturally occurring geologic hydrogen @incer-valverdeColorsHydrogenDefinitions2023 . While these colorful labels aid discussion, in practice, hydrogen is further judged by purity and usage standards. The ISO 14687 standard specifies two grades of hydrogen fuel for PEM fuel cell road vehicles: Type I Grade D (gaseous) and Type II Grade D (liquid) hydrogen @beureyReviewSurveyMethods2021 . Type I Grade D gaseous hydrogen, used for compressed H₂ tanks in cars and buses, must have a minimum hydrogen content of 99.97% (fuel index) with total non-H₂ impurities ≤300 µmol/mol. This corresponds to SAE J2719 and ISO requirements that limit key contaminants (H₂O, O₂, N₂, CO, CO₂, CH₄, sulfur compounds, etc.) to parts-per-million or lower levels to avoid poisoning the fuel cell. @postHydrogenContaminantDetector Type II Grade D liquid hydrogen has a similarly stringent purity but for cryogenic liquid fuel systems @hookhamImpactHydrogenLiquefaction2022 . Notably, such high purities are most readily achieved by electrolytic hydrogen (which is produced at high purity by default).






## **PEM Electrolyser Design**



Hydrogen production in PEM elctrolyser is an electrochemical process that decomposes water into oxygen and Hydrogen. It does so in two half cell reactions. Deionized water is supplied to the anode side of the cell. The water is oxidized into oxygen gas ($\text{O}_2$), protons ($\text{H}^+$), and electrons ($\text{e}^-$) through an Oxygen evolution Reaction. The reaction is:
    $2 \text{ H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{O}_2 + 4 \text{ H}^+ + 4 \text{ e}^-$
The protons ($\text{H}^+$) produced are conducted through the solid polymer membrane to the cathode side. The membrane is designed to be selective to proton over of oxygen gas. 
At the cathode, a platinum on carbon, Pt/C facilitates the reduction of protons into hydrogen. . The reaction is:
    $4 \text{ H}^+ + 4 \text{ e}^- \rightarrow 2 \text{ H}_2$
 The net result across the cell is the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen:
    $2 \text{ H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2 \text{ H}_2 + \text{O}_2$




A PEM electrolyzer cell comprises the Bipolar Plates , the gas diffusion layer or porous transport layer, and the catalyst layers sandwiched between the cation exchange membrane.


[MEA image here]
### **Cell Structure and MEA Design:** 
The fundamental unit of a PEM electrolyzer is a single electrolysis cell composed of a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) pressed between two flow-field plates (bipolar plates). The MEA  consists of a thin proton-conducting polymer membrane (≈50–200 µm thick) coated on each side with porous catalyst layers (anode and cathode). @ahmadkamaroddinMembraneBasedElectrolysisHydrogen2021 In a state-of-the-art design, these catalyst layers are applied directly onto the membrane – a configuration called catalyst-coated membrane (CCM). Alternatively, the catalyst can be applied onto a porous substrate (such as the gas diffusion layer) and then assembled against the membrane; this is known as catalyst-coated substrate (CCS) or decal transfer method @zhaoStructurePropertyPerformance2023 , @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 . The CCM approach yields a more integrated interface: the catalyst layers adhere strongly to the membrane and have low contact resistance, enabling higher performance and durability    @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Experiments have shown that CCM-based MEAs slightly outperform those with catalysts on the substrate due to better interface conductivity and utilization of the catalyst @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Additional advantages of CCMs include dimensional stability and ease of handling. They experience less mechanical deformation or decoupling from electrodes during hydration and dehydration cycles, and CCM MEAs can be readily removed and replaced in stack maintenance   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . A study demonstrated continuous operation over 20,000 hours with a CCM-based PEM electrolyzer cell, highlighting the robustness of the bonded interface   @milletElectrochemicalPerformancesPEM2011 , @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . By contrast, in early CCS designs, achieving uniform contact between separate electrode layers and the membrane was challenging, which could lead to higher resistance or delamination over time  @vinodhRecentAdvancementsCatalyst2024 . 
[MEA config image here]
The catalyst-coated membrane is sandwiched by a porous transport layer (PTL)  ( gas diffusion layer (GDL) or current collector) to facilitate reactant flow, product removal, and electron conduction. In PEM fuel cells, the GDL is usually a carbon fiber paper or cloth, but in PEM electrolyzers, the anode environment is highly oxidizing (O₂ at ~2 V vs. RHE), so corrosion-resistant titanium felts or sintered porous Ti are used for the PTL on the oxygen side   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The cathode PTL can be carbon-based if kept at low potential, but often titanium is also used to ensure longevity, especially since any oxygen crossover could create a local fuel cell reverse-potential on the cathode carbon @vinodhRecentAdvancementsCatalyst2024 . The PTL distributes liquid water from the flow field channels to the anode catalyst while allowing oxygen gas bubbles to escape back to the channels. At the cathode, the PTL/GDL provides pathways for hydrogen gas to exit and for excess water (if any) to be removed. It also conducts electrons from the cathode catalyst layer to the bipolar plate. Because the anode PTL is often made of titanium (to resist corrosion), its surface may form a thin oxide that increases contact resistance over time. To mitigate this, manufacturers often coat the Ti PTL or bipolar plate with noble metals (e.g., a thin layer of gold or platinum) to preserve low interfacial resistance @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 . The PTL design (felt vs. sintered powder vs. mesh) and its thickness can significantly impact performance. Thinner PTLs reduce ohmic drop and improve mass transport, but too thin a PTL might have inhomogeneous contact with the catalyst layer @zhaoStructurePropertyPerformance2023 .

![[image-64.png]]
### **Membrane Material**
The polymer electrolyte membrane in PEM electrolyzers not only conducts protons but also serves as the gas separator between H₂ and O₂. The state-of-the-art membrane material is a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomer, exemplified by Nafion (developed by DuPont). PFSAs have high proton conductivity (on the order of 0.1 S/cm when fully hydrated at 80 °C) and excellent chemical stability in the harsh oxidative environment @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Their mechanical toughness and long track record in PEM fuel cells made them a natural choice for electrolyzers as well   @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . However, PFSA membranes have notable drawbacks: cost and, environmental impact and gas permeability @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . Moreover, Nafion and similar PFSAs exhibit significant hydrogen crossover, especially at higher temperatures or thinner membrane thickness @ngStateofArtDevelopmentNafionBased2022 .
These issues have prompted research into hydrocarbon-based membranes. Hydrocarbon proton exchange membranes (such as sulfonated polyarylene ethers, polyetherketones, or polyphenylene sulfones) generally have lower gas permeability than PFSA because of their tighter polymer morphology @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . They also can be cheaper and have a smaller environmental footprint (no fluorine). Early skepticism about hydrocarbon membranes in fuel cells stemmed from their lower chemical stability under radical attack and sometimes lower conductivity at equivalent thickness. However, for PEM electrolyzers, the appeal of hydrocarbon membranes is strong. They can reduce hydrogen crossover while maintaining similar proton conductivity when fully hydrated @bhalaniHydrogenSeparationMembranes2024  ,  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . They also often tolerate higher operating temperatures (>80 °C) without degrading, potentially improving kinetics and heat rejection  @shinHydrocarbonBasedPolymerElectrolyte2017 . Recent breakthroughs have shown that all-hydrocarbon MEAs can meet or even exceed Nafion's performance. Klose _et al._ (2020) demonstrated a PEM electrolyzer MEA using a sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) (sPPS) membrane that achieved 3.5 A/cm² at 1.8 V, thus more than double the current density of a Nafion 115 baseline MEA (~1.5 A/cm² at 1.8 V)   @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . The hydrocarbon membrane MEA had ~threefold lower high-frequency resistance and one-third the H₂ crossover of Nafion, enabling both higher efficiency and inherent safety margins   @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . The remaining challenge is ensuring long-term chemical stability. The current focus has been developing reinforced or chemically stabilized hydrocarbon membranes and exploring additives to extend the lifetime in hot, O₂-rich conditions @escorihuelaDeepInsightDifferent2020 . Another approach is composite membranes, which combine a PFSA with a porous or inert backbone to reduce swelling and crossover. For example, adding inorganic fillers (like silica, zirconia, or graphene oxide) to Nafion can lower its gas permeability by filling voids, albeit sometimes at the cost of slightly lower conductivity  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  . Reinforced membranes (e.g., expanded PTFE-reinforced Nafion) are used in some commercial electrolyzers to improve mechanical strength, allowing thinner membranes that still resist pinhole formation and hydrogen leaks. The ideal membrane would be thin, highly proton-conductive, impermeable to gases, durable in hot acidic oxygen, and low-cost. Advances in hydrocarbon and composite membranes are actively moving the field toward these goals  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 .

Electrocatalysts
The state-of-the-art OER catalyst in PEM systems is **iridium oxide (IrO₂)** or iridium mixed oxides (IrO₂ doped with ruthenium or other elements) @abdolrahimOverviewPolymerElectrolyte2016  . IrO₂ offers a balance of reasonable activity and adequate stability. Ruthenium oxide (RuO₂) actually has higher intrinsic OER activity (lower overpotential), but pure RuO₂ anodes corrode rapidly in acidic OER conditions, leading to short life   @suermannComparingKineticActivation2018 , @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Previous studies in 1976 established the activity trends for OER and HER catalysts. Miles and Thomason identified among single metals that the OER activity (at 80 °C in acid) follows the order  Ir ≈ Ru > Pd > Rh > Pt > Au  @milesPeriodicVariationsOvervoltages1976 . Similarly, for the HER, the order was   Pd > Pt > Rh > Ir > … > Ni (with palladium and platinum being the best pure metals for H⁺ reduction) @milesPeriodicVariationsOvervoltages1976 . These findings explain the choice of Pt and Ir as the primary electrocatalysts. Most PEM anodes often use iridium in oxide form (IrO₂ or Ir black, which forms IrO₂ in situ) with loadings ~1–2 mg_Ir/cm²  and ESCA of 601 μC/cm² @zhaoDeterminingElectrochemicallyActive2015 . Even at those loadings, iridium’s scarcity is a serious concern as its supply is limited. @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Approaches in R&D to reduce Ir usage include developing high-surface-area IrO₂ nanoparticles or nano-porous iridium that have higher mass activity @kreiderUnderstandingEffectsAnode2024 , @mohantaImpactMembraneTypes2020 , @darabInfluenceCatalystLayer2017 , @leeOptimizingCatalystLoading2021 . By alloying Ir with more abundant elements such as Ir–Ni or Ir–W mixed oxides to dilute the Ir content or finding alternative OER catalysts. Some alternative catalysts are crystalline mixed oxides like pyrochlores (e.g., Pb₂Ir₂O₇₋ₓ), perovskites (SrRuO₃, etc.), or novel formulations like transition metal phosphides or nitrides. However, no completely platinum-group-metal-free catalyst has yet demonstrated both high OER activity and sufficient stability in the PEM electrolyzer environment @ayersHighEfficiencyPEM2021. Non-noble candidates (e.g., manganese or cobalt oxides) tend to dissolve in acidic electrolytes under OER conditions. Research by Rasten et al. explored the impact of annealing temperature on catalysts within MEAs. Their findings indicated that higher annealing temperatures resulted in larger, more crystalline particles, which decreased electrocatalytic activity but improved electronic conductivity. This trade-off meant that the overall electrode performance (total polarization) was optimized at a moderate annealing temperature @sharmaCrystallineDisorderSurface2021.

On the HER side, there is some progress in PGM-free catalysts. Molybdenum sulfides and tungsten carbide materials have shown HER activity in acid, but their stability is also an issue. Given that the cathode Pt loading is already low and contributes minimally to cost, the focus remains on the anode. One promising avenue is to deploy ultra-low Ir loadings by exploiting advanced supports: Carmo _et al._ note that efforts in catalyst development include novel support materials that increase utilization of Ir and investigations into catalysts like crystalline IrRuOx or metastable phase oxides that might achieve higher activity per mass of Ir  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Also, the DOE “ElectroCat” program has targeted PGM-free catalysts for low-temperature electrolyzers @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction , though mainly for anion-exchange membrane (AEM) systems where the alkaline environment permits non-noble metals.

### Bipolar Plates and Flow Fields:
The bipolar plate (BPP) in a PEM electrolyzer serves as both the anode of one cell and the cathode of the next cell in a series stack (hence "bipolar"). It provides structural support, separates gases between cells, conducts electrical current, and incorporates flow channels to distribute water and collect gases. Bipolar plates are commonly made of titanium in PEM water electrolyzers due to titanium's corrosion resistance in acidic, oxygen-rich conditions @LowCostDurableBipolar , @gagoProtectiveCoatingsStainless2016
Several flow field patterns are used: parallel channels, single-serpentine (a single long channel that winds across the plate), multiple serpentine (several shorter serpentine paths in parallel), grid/mesh patterns, and pin-hole or porous distributor plates @maierMassTransportPEM2022   . Each has pros and cons. Parallel channels offer low-pressure drop, which is advantageous for pumping efficiency, but can suffer from uneven flow distribution  @maierMassTransportPEM2022  . In a single serpentine flow field, all water and gas move through one channel. This design produces significantly higher local flow velocities than a parallel flow field, which distributes flow across multiple channels. Thus, a single-serpentine flow field has a far higher pressure drop than a parallel design. @itoEffectFlowRegime2010 ,
 @maierMassTransportPEM2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . Multi-serpentine designs attempt to balance distribution and pressure. In PEM fuel cells, serpentine and interdigitated flows are common to manage liquid water removal, whereas in electrolyzers, managing gas (oxygen) removal from the anode is the key challenge (the cathode hydrogen is usually less volumetric since 1 H₂ vs 0.5 O₂ per water) @tanerTechnoeconomicAnalysisMore2019  
Studies on the impact of flow field design on PEM electrolyzer performance have yielded conflicting results. Ito et al. observed better performance with a parallel flow field compared to a single-serpentine design up to 1.0 A/cm², attributing this to differences in concentration overpotential, although this explanation may be less significant at lower current densities @itoEffectFlowRegime2010 . Similarly, Another study reported improved performance for parallel flow fields at current densities up to 3.0 A/cm², while Li et al.'s research indicated superior performance for a single-serpentine configuration @majasanTwophaseFlowBehaviour2018 , @liEffectFlowfieldPattern2018 . Several other designs, such as interdigitated and pin-type flow fields, are available in literature but not so common in practice. @minnaarCurrentDensityDistribution2020 , @olesenUniformlyDistributedHeat2019 , @lafmejaniVOFModellingGas2017,  Additive manufacturing has also been explored for complex bipolar plate geometries (e.g. flow fields with internal cooling or novel 3D patterns) @yangFullyPrintedIntegrated2018 , @chisholm3DPrintedFlow2014

The influence of the flow regime on the performance of Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysers (PEMWEs) is explained by two contradicting models found in the literature. Particularly with respect to concentration overpotential, these models present different perspectives on how the hydrodynamics inside the flow channels affect the electrochemical efficiency of the system.
The first model holds that the performance of the electrolyzer suffers when gas slugs grow inside the flow channels @itoExperimentalStudyPorous2012 . From this point of view, the development of these slugs blocks the flow channels, therefore preventing the movement of liquid water to the liquid-gas diffusion layer (LGDL) and, hence, to the active catalyst sites where the oxygen evolution reaction takes place. This mass transfer restriction of the reactant (water) causes the concentration overpotential to rise, which shows up as a drop in the general cell performance. At high current densities, where the rate of gas evolution is increases significantly, this phenomenon is very important @itoExperimentalStudyPorous2012 .

On the other hand, the second model suggests that performance might be improved by the gas bubbles in the flow channels. From this point of view, turbulence in the flow is caused by bubbles, especially bigger ones @dedigamaCurrentDensityMapping2014 . Smaller bubbles from the surface of the LGDL are supposed to detach under the influence of this localized turbulence. By means of efficient elimination of these bubbles from the porous transport medium, water ingress is enhanced, and product gases from the catalyst layer can egress more easily. This process is proposed to lower the concentration overpotential by accelerating the mass transfer of both reactants and products, hence improving the general efficiency of the PEMWE. 

One application of the porous BPP design is the Toyota Mirai fuel cell, which inspires similar approaches in electrolyzers to enhance uniformity @liuReviewProtonExchange2022  @wangPEMFuelCell2022 . It provides a multitude of paths for fluids, improving distribution and reducing stagnant zones; it also eliminates the "land/channel" pattern of conventional fields, possibly reducing local hotspots or dry spots @wangPEMFuelCell2022 .   However, porous flow fields tend to impose a higher flow resistance across the entire area (since fluid percolates through tiny pores), meaning higher pumping energy and careful design to avoid large pressure differences  @maierMassTransportPEM2022; @liuReviewProtonExchange2022 , @wangPEMFuelCell2022 .

### Degradation
Key failure and degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers include membrane degradation, catalyst degradation, gas crossover, and component corrosion. The membrane can degrade via chemical attack (radical species like •OH or •OOH generated by trace impurities or by catalyst interactions can attack the polymer) and mechanical stress (swelling/shrinking during wet-dry cycles or differential pressure stress) @madhavReviewProtonExchange2024  , @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Over time, membranes can develop pinhole leaks or cracks that dramatically increase H₂/O₂ crossover @fengReviewProtonExchange2017  . Once a pinhole forms, the cell often must be shut down because the product gases begin to mix. To mitigate this, thicker membranes or reinforced membranes are used, but at the cost of higher ohmic resistance  
@comsPFSAMembraneThickness2022 , @fengReviewProtonExchange2017 ,  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . As noted earlier, using hydrocarbon membranes or composite structures can lower gas crossover, delaying this failure @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . The gas crossover itself is a silent degradation issue. Even if it does not reach flammability, permeated H₂ to the anode causes a loss of Faradaic efficiency (some H₂ is wasted), and permeated O₂ to the cathode can poison the catalyst or cause undesirable reverse reactions. Crossover increases exponentially with membrane thinning and also with pressure differential  @comsPFSAMembraneThickness2022 , @fengReviewProtonExchange2017  . Thus, operating at very high pressure or using ultrathin membranes requires careful design (recombination catalysts embedded in frames, etc.). A typical safety measure is adding a recombination catalyst (often a small Pt/Pd catalyst) on the oxygen side to catalytically burn off any diffused H₂ into the water, maintaining H₂-in-O₂ below the LFL of 4%  @darabInfluenceCatalystLayer2017 ,  @kloseAllHydrocarbonMEAPEM2020 . This adds complexity and cost, however, and also consumes some product gas.
The catalysts can degrade primarily by dissolution and coarsening. At the OER anode, Ir dissolves slightly in the form of Ir ions, especially if the potential exceeds certain thresholds or during shutdowns when transient high potentials can occur. Lost Ir can redeposit as inactive agglomerates or even migrate and plate elsewhere (sometimes observed on membranes or cathodes). This leads to a loss of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) over time, raising the cell voltage for the same current. Shutdowns or potential reversal can cause high potentials and oxidize Pt at the cathode. Additionally, any oxygen crossover can create a local cell action that corrodes the carbon support or dissolves Pt @schneiderImpactPlatinumLoading2023 . Thus, some designs even avoid carbon supports on the cathode, using pure Pt black or alternative supports to ensure stability @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 .
Ionic impurities can migrate and cause local hot spots or membrane degradation (e.g., chloride traces can cause pitting corrosion of anode components and attack Nafion). 
Continuous operation of over 40,000 hours (~5 years) has been reported for some PEM systems, and DOE has set targets of 80,000 hour stack lifetime (about 9 years) by 2026 for PEM electrolyzers @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction akin to the lifetimes desired for stationary fuel cells. Achieving this will require minimizing all the above degradation factors. 




## Techno Economic Analysis

### Frameworks for Technoeconomic analysis


### Cost Drivers


[Badget image here]
![[image-62.png]]

Badgett et al. predict that several important factors will help to lower the cost of electrolysis-generated hydrogen. These comprise changes in the materials used and the design of the system, the scale of manufacturing activities, and the learning effect acquired from the actual implementation of more electrolysis systems. @badgettMethodsIdentifyingCost2021

Using techno-economic analyses (TEAs), one can investigate how changing various cost factors might affect the hydrogen cost and guide research, development, and electrolysis technology investment. These studies highlight their combined impact on the final cost of hydrogen production. It, therefore, explains the links between different components and provides a comprehensive view of electrolysis systems (Figure 1)  @badgettMethodsIdentifyingCost2021
. For example, the performance, manufacture, and related costs of the electrolyzer stack directly depend on its design. These elements, therefore, affect the capital expenses of the system as well as the rate of hydrogen generation, two important determinants of the total hydrogen cost. @badgettKeyPerformanceIndicators2023; @badgettEconomicAnalysisRole2022

Performance Improvements
enhancing the performance (efficiency and current density) of the electrolyzer lowers both capital-related costs and electricity consumption per kg H₂. Higher efficiency (lower cell voltage at a given current) means fewer kWh per kg, directly cutting the energy cost portion. The DOE and EU targets aim for cell efficiencies ~77% HHV (which is ~1.60 V per cell at moderate current density) by 2030, compared to ~60–65% HHV (1.8–2.0 V) typical today   @petersonHFTOHydrogenProduction . 
The technoeconomic balance between an electrolyzer producing at low pressure plus an external compressor vs. producing at high pressure directly is complex; studies have shown only modest net efficiency loss for moderate pressure (e.g. 30 bar) operation  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 , and when accounting for avoided compressor capital, high-pressure PEM electrolysis can be beneficial  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Many current systems compromise by producing H₂ at ~30 bar, which is a good trade-off for storage in tanks at 100–200 bar (the subsequent compression is easier than from 1 bar).
Learning  and scaling effects. Historically, technologies like solar PV and batteries have seen steep cost declines (~20% cost reduction for each doubling of cumulative production, known as Wright’s law or experience curves). Electrolyzers, being at an early stage, could follow a similar trajectory. Empirically, the Alkaline electrolyzer cost declined somewhat in the 2010s with more MW-scale deployments, and PEM is expected to follow. Analysts project that with tens of GW deployed by 2030, factory-built PEM electrolyzers could approach the $200/kW system cost level @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021  @pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021 . Government programs such as the U.S. DOE’s H2NEW consortium and EU’s Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on hydrogen are funding pilot manufacturing lines to drive this learning.

Various frameworks are available to evaluate hydrogen production economics. One common tool is the DOE’s **H2A (Hydrogen Analysis) model**, which is a publicly available discounted cash flow model tailored for hydrogen technologies @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . H2A provides a standardized way to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen ($/kg) given inputs like capital cost, efficiency, feedstock cost, capacity factor, financing, and plant life. It ensures consistent assumptions (e.g. a specified internal rate of return, depreciation, etc.) so that different production pathways (electrolysis, SMR, biomass gasification, etc.) can be compared on an even basis @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . 

H2A was used in a 2014 DOE study by Colella _et al._ to compare PEM electrolysis at “forecourt” scale (distributed, 1,500 kg H₂/day) and “central” scale (50,000 kg/day) for current technology vs. projected future improvements @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . That study identified the high capital cost and low capacity factor of forecourt electrolysis as key cost driver and noted that only with future cost reductions and cheap electricity could PEM electrolysis meet the DOE target of $2–4 /kg (untaxed) hydrogen @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014.
Besides H2A, other frameworks  models have been developed to optimize electrolyzer operation against time-of-day electricity prices – essentially a **techno-economic optimization** to minimize $/kg by deciding when to run the electrolyzer (this is relevant for grid-integrated projects). There are also learning curve models projecting how costs fall with cumulative capacity. 
Current cost models provide valuable insights but also have limitations. Traditional H2A-style analyses assume a relatively steady operating profile and often base inputs on today’s costs or optimistic future estimates @marzoukLevelizedCostGreen2023. One critique is that many TEA studies assume high capacity factors (e.g. electrolyzer running 90% of the time) to drive down hydrogen cost, whereas if paired with intermittent renewables without grid backup, the capacity factor may be much lower (solar-only electrolysis might run ~20–25% of hours)  @suCapacityConfigurationOptimization2023 . A few studies incorporate the cost of energy storage or grid connection to boost capacity factor such as including a battery or allowing grid electricity at times to supplement renewables @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024; @khanDesigningOptimalIntegrated; @kimTechnoeconomicAnalysisAnion2024.

Another consideration often simplified is degradation and replacement. Most LCOH models usually includes a stack replacement cost at a certain interval (e.g. every 7 years) . However, degradation is a continuous process and can also increase operating power needs over time. Few models fully integrate performance degradation into the cost calculation @khatibMaterialDegradationComponents2019.

It’s also noted that some cost studies use historically low renewable prices and assume they can be fully dedicated to H₂ production. While renewable PPA prices have dropped dramatically (wind and solar < $20/MWh in best cases @GreenHydrogenCost2020 ), the reality of procuring large volumes of such low-cost electricity for electrolysis may involve additional grid costs or variability. Models that assume constant $20/MWh power may be oversimplified; a more realistic modeling might use hourly price distributions or a mix of solar and wind profiles @bracciCostComparisonVarious2023 . The new IRS rules (additionality, hourly matching) effectively force such granular accounting, which will influence future TEAs. @bracciCostComparisonVarious2023  A recent analysis by' Resources for the Future' found that strict hourly matching could increase hydrogen costs by 5–25% compared to annual matching, due to needing either oversized renewables or more expensive storage to cover lulls @45VHydrogenTax.

The technoeconomic literature on PEM electrolysis is growing, but there are gaps. One gap is real-world data from existing projects – many models rely on projections and vendor quotes, but as more 10+ MW projects come online, empirical performance and cost data should be fed back into analyses. There’s an opportunity for studies on **learning rates** specific to electrolyzers: how quickly will costs fall as manufacturing scales?  Another gap is the **system-level integration cost**: electrolyzer cost models often exclude the cost of integrating with renewables (transmission, firming capacity, etc.). For truly green hydrogen, one must sometimes overbuild renewables or include energy storage, and those costs need to be considered. There is a need to explore the influence of carbon pricing, renewables curtailment, and electrolyzer economics. With carbon prices or credits like 45V, the effective cost of green H₂ to a producer can be negative (a subsidy) up to the credit value – but that requires compliance with those rules, which adds operational constraints.

Finally, there is an opportunity in technoeconomic optimization of electrolyzer **stack design vs. operating strategy**. For instance, a more expensive, durable stack might economically allow a flexible low-capacity-factor operation (using only cheap electricity), whereas a cheaper but less robust stack might need steady operation. The current literature seldom links design parameters (membrane thickness, catalyst loading, etc.) to economic outcomes explicitly. Developing multi-physics TEA models that co-optimize performance and cost could guide R&D. Questions such as is it worth doubling catalyst to gain efficiency? At what iridium price does that trade-off flip? Such questions are vital as materials like Ir become constraints.
