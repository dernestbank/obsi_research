# Background

Central to the MEA design are the **membrane thickness** and **catalyst layer characteristics** (including thickness, porosity, catalyst loading, and ionomer content), which jointly affect the **electrochemical performance**, **gas crossover**, **Faraday efficiency**, and **overall system cost**.
The design space is **multi-dimensional and non-linear**, involving trade-offs that cannot be optimized independently. Hence, **multi-objective optimization (MOO)** techniques are essential to simultaneously balance **efficiency**, **durability**, and **economic feasibility**

## 2. Membrane Thickness: Effects and Trade-offs

### A. Ohmic Overpotential ($\eta_{\text{ohm}}$):

- Thinner membranes reduce the ionic path length and improve proton conductivity.
- According to Ohm‚Äôs law:
$$
  \eta_{\text{ohm}} = i \cdot \frac{t_{\text{mem}}}{\kappa_{\text{mem}}}
  $$
  where $\kappa_{\text{mem}}$ increases with water content and temperature.

- **Trade-off:** Thinner membranes reduce $\eta_{\text{ohm}}$ and improve energy efficiency but are more prone to **mechanical failure** and **gas crossover**.

---

### B. Gas Crossover and Faraday Efficiency ($\eta_F$):

- Thinner membranes lead to higher hydrogen and oxygen permeability:
  $$
  J_{\text{crossover}} \propto \frac{D_{\text{gas}}}{t_{\text{mem}}}
  $$
  leading to **lower Faraday efficiency**:
$$
  \eta_F = 1 - \frac{i_{\text{crossover}}}{i_{\text{total}}}
  $$
- **Trade-off:** Higher gas crossover increases **safety risks** (H$_2$/O$_2$ mixing), **parasitic current loss**, and **thermal load** due to recombination.

---

### C. Mechanical and Durability Considerations:

- Thinner membranes are **less robust** under pressure and hydration cycling, increasing failure risk.
- Thicker membranes offer **better chemical durability** but worsen **ohmic losses**.


## 3. Catalyst Layer Thickness and Loading

### A. Activation Overpotential ($\eta_{\text{act}}$):

- Increased catalyst loading (mass per unit area) provides more electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), reducing $\eta_{\text{act}}$ via:
  $$
  i = i_0 \left[ \exp\left( \frac{\alpha F \eta_{\text{act}}}{RT} \right) - 1 \right]
  $$
  where $i_0 \propto \text{ECSA}$.

- **Trade-off:** Higher loading ‚Üí Lower $\eta_{\text{act}}$, but increased **material cost** (especially Ir-based OER catalysts) and thicker catalyst layer (CL).

---

### B. Ohmic and Mass Transport Resistance:

- Thicker catalyst layers cause:
  - Increased **proton transport resistance** due to longer ionomer paths.
  - Increased **electron path resistance** (through carbon network).
  - Potentially greater **flooding** or **gas bubble entrapment**, especially at the oxygen-evolving anode.

---

### C. Concentration Overpotential ($\eta_{\text{conc}}$):

- A thicker or denser catalyst layer can hinder gas evolution and water transport:

  $$
  \eta_{\text{conc}} = - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln\left( 1 - \frac{i}{i_L} \right)
  $$

  where $i_L$ is the limiting current density affected by **porosity**, **tortuosity**, and **pore structure**.

- **Trade-off:** Thin CL improves mass transport but may **underutilize catalyst** and raise $\eta_{\text{act}}$.




Problem:
	Tradeoff in MEA component in PEM electrolyser
	membrane thickness influence more ohmic overpotentials: thinner membranes with few electrodes
	A thinner membrane reduces ionic resistance (good for performance) but increases gas crossover and may have lower mechanical strength. Nafion membranes come in various thicknesses
	_tmem_ appears in ohm‚Äôs law for membrane voltage drop ($V_{\text{ohm}} = i \cdot t_{\text{mem}}/\kappa_{\text{mem}}$) and in the diffusion length for water crossover. 
Thinner membranes may also have lower water intake capacity(less volume to hold water), which can lead to a more rapid drying if water balance isn't mantained at downtimes.
	- thinner membranes might increase shunt currents (in electrolyzers) due to higher ionic conductivity of leakage paths


### Interdependencies and Overall MEA Design Considerations

The design of the MEA must recognize that the catalyst layer and membrane are interdependent:

- **Water Management:** The amount of water in the catalyst layer affects proton transport both in the catalyst layer and in the membrane. Both layers need to be optimized together to achieve a uniform water distribution that maximizes performance while minimizing flooding or drying.
    
- **Thermal Effects:** Elevated operating temperatures can improve kinetics and ionic conductivity, but they also increase water vapor pressure, which may exacerbate drying of the membrane or promote excessive gas crossover if the membrane is too thin.
    
- **Mechanical Assembly:** Compression during MEA assembly affects both the catalyst layer (by impacting pore structure and contact resistance) and the membrane (by potentially changing its effective thickness and permeability). Too much compression can damage the catalyst layer or alter the membrane‚Äôs microstructure, while too little can lead to poor electrical contact and increased resistance.
    
- **Coupling of Mass and Charge Transport:** The optimization problem inherently involves the balance between high surface area (for improved kinetics) and low mass transport resistance. High ionomer content in the catalyst layer enhances proton conduction but might restrict gas diffusion; similarly, thin membranes favor low ohmic loss but can worsen gas crossover and mechanical stability.


an optimal PEM electrolyzer MEA design involves balancing:

- Catalyst layer trade-offs between catalyst loading, layer thickness, porosity, ionomer content, and pore structure to maximize active area and kinetics while minimizing diffusion barriers.
    
- Membrane trade-offs between thinness (for high conductivity) and thickness (to reduce gas crossover and improve durability), alongside ensuring appropriate water management and mechanical robustness.

## 5. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) Framework

Given the conflicting objectives, an MOO framework is necessary. The **two primary objectives** are:

- **Minimize energy loss (maximize cell efficiency):**
$$F_1 (x) = -\eta_{HHV}(X)$$
which includes cross overeffect, shunt current, bubble effects, overpotentials


- Minimize the cost of construction by minimizing the size-thickness of the MEA.

Minimize $$t_{MEA‚Äã(x)}=t_{mem}‚Äã+t_{anode,CL}‚Äã+t_{cathode,CL}‚Äã$$
This directly represents minimizing the total physical thickness of the MEA layers.


> [!NOTE]
> (Note: While minimizing total thickness is requested, the dominant cost factor is often the Platinum Group Metal (PGM) content. A more direct cost objective could be minimizing the total PGM mass,)



## Objective Functions:

We define two primary objectives: efficiency and cost.
### 2.1 Efficiency Objective

For a stack of cells, we start with the hydrogen production of a single cell. The mass flow rate of hydrogen produced in one cell is given
$$
\dot{m}_{\text{H}_2} = \frac{i \, A_{\text{cell}} \cdot 3600 \, MW_{\text{H}_2} \, \eta_F}{2F},
$$

where:
- $i$ is the current density (A/cm¬≤),
- $A_{\text{cell}}$ is the effective area of the cell (cm¬≤),
- `3600` converts seconds to hours,
- $MW_{\text{H}_2}$ is the molecular weight of hydrogen (kg/mol),
- $\eta_F$ is the Faradaic efficiency (typically close to 1),
- $F$ is Faraday‚Äôs constant (‚âà 96485 C/mol).

The total electrical energy input (per unit time) for a cell is:

$$
P_{\text{in}} = V_{\text{cell}}(x) \cdot (i \, A_{\text{cell}}),
$$

where the cell voltage $V_{\text{cell}}(x)$ is modeled as:

$$
V_{\text{cell}}(x) = V_{\text{oc}}(T, p_{\text{an}}, p_{\text{cat}}) + \Delta V_{\text{act}}(i) + \Delta V_{\text{ohm}}(t_m, i, T) + \Delta V_{\text{conc}}(i).
$$
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The Vact should relate the proper ties of the electrode</mark>
Here:
- $V_{\text{oc}}$ is the open-circuit voltage (a function of temperature $T$ and electrode pressures $p_{\text{an}}$, $p_{\text{cat}}$),
- $\Delta V_{\text{act}}(i)$ is the total activation overpotential (using Tafel or Butler‚ÄìVolmer equations),
- $\Delta V_{\text{ohm}}(t_m, i, T)$ comprises:

  - Membrane ohmic drop:    $\Delta V_{\text{ohm, mem}} = i \frac{t_m}{\sigma_{\text{mem}}(T, \lambda)},$
  - Electrode ohmic drop:    $\Delta V_{\text{ohm, el}} = i \frac{t_{\text{el}}}{\sigma_{\text{el}}},$

- $\Delta V_{\text{conc}}(i)$ is the concentration overpotential modeled by a relation such as ...
$$
\Delta V_{\text{conc}}(i) = \frac{RT}{z \, \alpha_{\text{conc}} \, F} \ln\left( \frac{i_{\text{lim}} - i}{i_{\text{lim}}} \right)
$$

Then, the instantaneous energy efficiency is:

$$
\eta_{\text{energy}}(x) = \frac{HHV_{\text{H}_2} \cdot \dot{m}_{\text{H}_2}}{V_{\text{cell}}(x) \cdot (i \, A_{\text{cell}}) \cdot N_{\text{cell}}},
$$

where $N_{\text{cell}}$ is the number of cells in the stack (assumed constant if each cell is identical).

For optimization, we express the efficiency objective as a minimization of the negative efficiency:

$$
f_1(x) = -\eta_{\text{energy}}(x)
$$

In our detailed model, many of the terms (e.g., $\sigma_{\text{mem}}(T, \lambda)$, which depends on water uptake, and activation overpotentials that depend on exchange current densities) are functions of the decision variables $x$ (for example, temperature $T$, membrane thickness $t_m$, and water uptake $\lambda$).

Electrode parameters (porosity $\varepsilon$, tortuosity $\tau$, pore radius $r_p$, capillary effects, and electrochemically active surface area $A_{\text{ECSA}}$) influence $\Delta V_{\text{act}}(i)$ and $\Delta V_{\text{ohm}}$, since these factors affect the effective catalytic reaction rate and electronic resistivity. These relationships can be incorporated using empirical correlations (or microstructural models) such as:.........



We define energy efficiency as the ratio of the chemical energy of the produced hydrogen (using its higher heating value) to the electrical energy input:
$$
Œ∑energy = \frac{HHV_{H_2} \cdot r_{H_2}}{V_{\text{stack}} }
$$
$HHV_{H_2}$ is the higher heating value of hydrogen (J/mol or J/kg),
- $r_{H_2}$ is the hydrogen production rate (mol/s or kg/s),

In a stack of $N_{\text{cell}}$ cells:

$$
V_{\text{stack}} = N_{\text{cell}} V_{\text{cell}}
$$
$$
V_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{rev}} + V_{\text{act, anode}} + V_{\text{act, cathode}} + V_{\text{ohm}} + V_{\text{conc}}
$$

We then define the first objective function as

$\textbf{Maximize } f_1(x) = \eta_{\text{energy}}(x).$

### **Design Variables:**

the most direct variables related to thickness and catalyst cost/performance are:

- $t_{mem‚Äã}$: Membrane thickness (e.g., in Œºm or cm)
- $t_{anode,CL}‚Äã$: Anode Catalyst Layer thickness (e.g., in Œºm or cm)
- $t_{cathode,CL}$‚Äã: Cathode Catalyst Layer thickness (e.g., in Œºm or cm)
- $m_{cat,anode}‚Äã$: Anode Catalyst Loading (e.g., in mg/cm$^2$, specifically PGM loading )
- $m_{cat,cathode‚Äã}$: Cathode Catalyst Loading (e.g., in mg/cm$^2$, specifically PGM loading if applicable)




Other variables.
- 
- Catalyst layer porosity & thickness
- Ionomer weight fraction in CL
- Operating temperature, pressure, current density
- Cell area,
-

### **Constraints:**

**Variable Bounds:**

- $t_{mem,min}‚Äã‚â§t_{mem‚Äã}‚â§t_{mem,max‚Äã}$
- $t_{anode,CL,min‚Äã} ‚â§t_{anode,CL}‚Äã‚â§t_{anode,CL,max‚Äã}$
- $t_{cathode,CL,min}‚Äã‚â§t_{cathode,CL‚Äã}‚â§t_{cathode,CL,max‚Äã}$
- $m_{cat,anode,min}‚Äã‚â§m_{cat,anode‚Äã}‚â§m_{cat,anode,max‚Äã}$
- $m_{cat,cathode,min}‚Äã‚â§m_{cat,cathode‚Äã}‚â§m_{cat,cathode,max‚Äã}$
membrane must be thick enough to prevent excessive gas crossover)

**Performance Constraints:** The electrolyzer must operate effectively at a specified condition

limiting the maximum cell voltage at a target current density to ensure acceptable performance and efficiency (as high voltage means high overpotentials/losses).
Vcell‚Äã(x)‚â§Vcell,max‚Äã at a defined operating point (e.g., i=itarget‚Äã, T=Top‚Äã, P=Pop‚Äã) where Vcell‚Äã(x) is the single-cell voltage calculated


- Faraday efficiency $\eta_F > 98\%$
- Hydrogen purity (crossover < safety limit)
- Durability targets (>10,000 hours)


## 3. Constraints

### 3.1 Physical and Operational Constraints

- **Voltage Constraint:** $V_{\min} \leq V_{\text{cell}}(x) \leq V_{\max}$
- **Current Density Constraint:** $j_{\min} \leq j \leq j_{\max}$
- **Thickness Constraint for Manufacturability:** $t \geq t_{\min}$ (set by production capabilities)




### 3.3 Mechanical Durability Constraint
- Additionally, we impose the mechanical durability constraint on the membrane
-For the mechanical integrity of the MEA, the membrane  must satisfy a stress constraint. Using a simplified thin-plate model under pressure difference ŒîP 
$$
\sigma \approx k \frac{\Delta P \, r^2}{t_{\text{mem}}^2}
$$

- $\sigma$ is the estimated stress,
- $r$ is a characteristic dimension (e.g., effective radius of the membrane area),
- $t$ is the membrane thickness, and
- $k$ is a geometric constant.
To ensure that this stress be below an allowable level defined by the tensile strength $\sigma_{\text{tensile}}$ divided by a safety factor (SF):

$$
\sigma \leq \frac{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}{SF}.
$$

$$
k \frac{\Delta P \, r^2}{t^2} \leq \frac{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}{SF}.
$$

The allowable stress is $\frac{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}{SF}$. Therefore, to ensure safety:

$$
t_{\text{mem}} \geq t_{\text{mech,min}} = r \sqrt{\frac{k \, \Delta P \, SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}},
$$

or equivalently,

$$
g_2(x) = t_{\text{mech,min}} - t_{\text{mem}} \leq 0.
$$

### 3.3 Operational and Physical Bounds

The decision variables are bounded as follows:

- **Membrane thickness**:

  $$
  t_{\text{mem,min}} \leq t_{\text{mem}} \leq t_{\text{mem,max}},
  $$

  where $t_{\text{mem,min}}$ here should be greater than or equal to the minimum required for both functionality and mechanical integrity.

- **Electrode (catalyst layer) thickness**:  $$
  t_{\text{el,min}} \leq t_{\text{el}} \leq t_{\text{el,max}}.
  $$
- **Current density**: $$
  i_{\text{min}} \leq i \leq i_{\text{lim}},
  $$
  where $i_{\text{lim}}$ is the limiting (maximum) current density (for example, 6 A/cm¬≤).

- **Temperature**:
  $$
  T_{\text{min}} \leq T \leq T_{\text{max}}.
  $$

with additional bounds for the electrode layer thickness $t_{\text{el}}$ (if chosen as a decision variable) and possibly others (e.g., temperature $T$). 

For simplicity, we assume that some parameters (such as electrode properties‚Äîporosity $\varepsilon$, tortuosity $\tau$, pore radius $r_p$, effective catalytic surface area $A_{\text{ECSA}}$) appear implicitly in the relations for $V_{\text{cell}}$ and $\Delta V_{\text{act}}$, so that their values are taken from empirical data or fixed in a preliminary analysis.

# PEM Electrolyzer Membrane Mechanical Durability Parameters

 reported literature values and typical ranges for the key mechanical durability parameters in PEM electrolyzer membrane design:

## **Reported Parameter Values**

| Parameter                     | Typical/Reported Values           | Literature Source(s) |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Membrane Thickness** ($t_{\text{mem}}$) | 50‚Äì200 Œºm (0.05‚Äì0.2 mm) for Nafion‚Ñ¢ | [3], [4]               |
| **Tensile Strength** ($\sigma_{\text{tensile}}$) | 25‚Äì40 MPa (Nafion‚Ñ¢ at room temperature) | [3], [4]               |
| **Pressure Difference** ($\Delta P$) | 1‚Äì30 bar (0.1‚Äì3 MPa) typical; up to 30 bar in high-pressure systems | [3], [8]               |
| **Characteristic Radius** ($r$) | 1‚Äì5 cm for lab/small cells; up to 10 cm for large-scale cells | [3], [5]               |
| **Safety Factor** ($SF$) | Commonly 2‚Äì5 for engineering design | [3], [4]               |
| **Geometric Constant** ($k$) | Depends on support and loading; for a simply supported circular membrane, $k \approx 3/(8\pi)$ (from plate theory) | Standard mechanical engineering texts; not directly reported in electrolyzer-specific literature, but used in analogous thin-plate stress models. |

### **Details and Context**

- **Membrane Thickness** ($t_{\text{mem}}$): Commercial PEMs such as Nafion‚Ñ¢ 115 and 117 are 125 Œºm and 175 Œºm thick, respectively. Research membranes can be as thin as 50 Œºm for performance, but mechanical durability is a concern at lower thicknesses[[3], [4]].
- **Tensile Strength** ($\sigma_{\text{tensile}}$): Nafion‚Ñ¢ tensile strength is typically reported as 25‚Äì40 MPa at room temperature, but decreases with temperature and hydration[[3], [4]].
- **Pressure Difference** ($\Delta P$): Most PEM electrolyzers operate at 1‚Äì30 bar; high-pressure designs may reach 30 bar (3 MPa)[[3], [8]].
- **Characteristic Radius** ($r$): For single cells, the effective radius is typically 1‚Äì5 cm; in stacks or large cells, it can be higher, but mechanical support structures are often used to mitigate stress[[3], [5]].
- **Safety Factor** ($SF$): Engineering practice for pressure vessels and critical components is to use a safety factor of 2‚Äì5[[3], [4]].
- **Geometric Constant** ($k$): For a simply supported, uniformly loaded circular membrane, $k \approx 3/(8\pi)$. This is a standard result in plate theory, though not always explicitly cited in electrolyzer literature.

> ‚ÄúConventional operation is characterized by pressures of ‚àº30 bar and temperatures of 50‚Äì90 ¬∞C. ... The mechanical integrity of the membrane is critical, as thinner membranes are more susceptible to mechanical failure under pressure differentials.‚Äù[[3]]

> ‚ÄúNafion membranes typically exhibit tensile strengths in the range of 25‚Äì40 MPa at room temperature.‚Äù[[4]]

> ‚ÄúCell-level durability analysis prioritizes membrane thickness optimization against mechanical failure, especially at elevated pressures.‚Äù[[3]]

If you need values for a specific membrane material or cell design, consult the manufacturer's datasheets or detailed mechanical studies for that material. The above values are representative for Nafion‚Ñ¢-type PEMs, which dominate the literature.

the multi-objective optimization problem for the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) of a PEM electrolyzer based on our custom PEM model.
The goal is to find MEA designs that represent the best trade-off between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing MEA thickness (as a proxy for cost), while satisfying critical operational and mechanical constraints.








# PEM Electrolyzer MEA Multi-Objective Optimization Problem

the multi-objective optimization problem for the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) of a PEM electrolyzer based on our PEM model. The goal is to find MEA designs that represent the best trade-off between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing MEA thickness (as a proxy for cost), while satisfying critical operational and mechanical constraints.

## Problem Statement

The multi-objective optimization problem can be formally stated as:

Minimize $F(x) = \begin{bmatrix} f_1(x) \\ f_2(x) \end{bmatrix}$

Subject to:
$g_i(x) \leq 0$ for $i = 1, \ldots, m$
$x_L \leq x \leq x_U$

where:
- $x$ is the vector of design variables.
- $F(x)$ is the vector of objective functions to be minimized.
- $f_1(x)$ is the first objective function (related to efficiency).
- $f_2(x)$ is the second objective function (related to thickness/cost).
- $g_i(x)$ are the inequality constraints.
- $x_L$ and $x_U$ are the lower and upper bounds for the design variables, respectively.

The underlying 2D PEM electrolyzer model serves as an implicit set of equality constraints, defining how the performance outputs are calculated based on the design variables and operating conditions.

## 1. Design Variables ($x$)

These are the parameters of the MEA that are during the optimization process.

$x = \begin{bmatrix} t_{\text{mem}} \\ t_{\text{elec},a} \\ t_{\text{elec},c} \\ m_{\text{cat},a} \\ m_{\text{cat},c} \end{bmatrix}$

Where:
- $t_{\text{mem}}$: Membrane thickness [cm]
- $t_{\text{elec},a}$: Anode catalyst layer thickness [cm]
- $t_{\text{elec},c}$: Cathode catalyst layer thickness [cm]
- $m_{\text{cat},a}$: Anode catalyst loading [mg/cm¬≤]
- $m_{\text{cat},c}$: Cathode catalyst loading [mg/cm¬≤]

## 2. Objective Functions ($F(x)$)

We aim to minimize two objective functions:

### Objective 1: Minimize Negative HHV Efficiency

Maximizing the Higher Heating Value (HHV) efficiency is equivalent to minimizing its negative.
$f_1(x) = -\eta_{\text{HHV}}(x)$

Where $\eta_{\text{HHV}}$ is calculated from our python model at a specified operating and design parameters. (e.g., target current density or voltage) using Equation (43):

$\eta_{\text{HHV}} = \frac{m_{H_2} \cdot HHV_{H_2}}{P_{\text{EL}}}$

And $m_{H_2}$ (Eq. 42) and $P_{\text{EL}}$ (Eq. 41) are derived from the model's outputs ($i, A_{\text{cell}}, V_{\text{cell}}, W_{\text{BoP}}$).

### Objective 2: Minimize MEA Total Thickness

Minimizing the total thickness of the MEA components directly relates to reducing material cost and potentially manufacturing complexity.

$f_2(x) = t_{\text{mem}} + t_{\text{elec},a} + t_{\text{elec},c}$

## 3. Constraints ($g_i(x) \leq 0$ and $x_L \leq x \leq x_U$)

The optimized design must satisfy several constraints:

### Variable Bounds ($x_L \leq x \leq x_U$):

Each design variable must be within a practical range dictated by manufacturing capabilities and material properties.

$t_{\text{mem,min}} \leq t_{\text{mem}} \leq t_{\text{mem,max}}$
$t_{\text{elec},a,\text{min}} \leq t_{\text{elec},a} \leq t_{\text{elec},a,\text{max}}$
$t_{\text{elec},c,\text{min}} \leq t_{\text{elec},c} \leq t_{\text{elec},c,\text{max}}$
$m_{\text{cat},a,\text{min}} \leq m_{\text{cat},a} \leq m_{\text{cat},a,\text{max}}$
$m_{\text{cat},c,\text{min}} \leq m_{\text{cat},c} \leq m_{\text{cat},c,\text{max}}$

Specify numerical values for these bounds are based on current technology and material data reported in literature.

### Mechanical Durability Constraint ($g_1(x) \leq 0$):

The membrane thickness must be sufficient to withstand the pressure difference ($\Delta P$) across it, based on the simplified mechanical model.

$t_{\text{mem}} \geq r \sqrt{\frac{k \cdot \Delta P \cdot SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}}$

This is formulated as an inequality constraint:

$g_1(x) = r \sqrt{\frac{k \cdot \Delta P \cdot SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}} - t_{\text{mem}} \leq 0$

(Define the values for $r, k, \Delta P, SF,$ and $\sigma_{\text{tensile}}$ based on your specific cell design and material properties).

### Performance Constraint (Example: 
#### Minimum Hydrogen Production Rate) ($g_2(x) \leq 0$):

The electrolyzer must produce hydrogen at a minimum rate at a specified operating point (e.g., at a cell voltage of $V_{op}$).

$m_{H_2}(x) \geq m_{H_2,\text{target}}$ (evaluated by the 2D model at $V_{\text{cell}} = V_{op}$)

This is formulated as an inequality constraint:

$g_2(x) = m_{H_2,\text{target}} - m_{H_2}(x) \leq 0$

(Alternatively, you could use a maximum voltage constraint at a target current density: $g_2(x) = V_{\text{cell}}(x) - V_{\text{cell,max}} \leq 0$ evaluated at $i = i_{op}$).

#### Minimum Faradaic Efficiency ($g_3(x) \leq 0$):

The Faradaic efficiency must be above a minimum acceptable level at the specified operating point.

$\eta_F(x) \geq \eta_{F,\text{min}}$ (evaluated by the 2D model at the same operating point)

This is formulated as an inequality constraint:

$g_3(x) = \eta_{F,\text{min}} - \eta_F(x) \leq 0$

#### Maximum Operating Temperature ($g_4(x) \leq 0$):

The maximum temperature reached within the MEA during operation should not exceed a limit to prevent accelerated degradation.

$T_{\text{max}}(x) \leq T_{op,\text{max}}$ (evaluated by the 2D model during operation)

This is formulated as an inequality constraint:

$g_4(x) = T_{\text{max}}(x) - T_{op,\text{max}} \leq 0$

(This constraint is applicable if your 2D model provides spatial temperature distribution).

### Implicit Model Constraints:

The physical laws and empirical relationships governing the PEM electrolyzer as described by your 2D model equations (thermodynamics, kinetics, transport, thermal, etc.) implicitly define the relationships between the design variables $x$ and the performance outputs used in the objective functions and constraints ($\eta_{\rm HHV}$, $m_{H_2}$, $V_{\text{cell}}$, $\eta_F$, $T_{\text{max}}$). These are not explicitly written as constraints in the optimization formulation but are handled by calling our PEMel model within the optimization algorithm to evaluate the objectives and constraints for each candidate design $x$.

## Solving the Problem

Solving this multi-objective optimization problem will typically involve using specialized algorithms (e.g., NSGA-II, MOEA/D, or other evolutionary algorithms suitable for multi-objective optimization). These algorithms explore the design space defined by the variables and constraints, using your 2D model to evaluate the performance of each potential design. The result will be a set of Pareto optimal solutions, representing the trade-off curve between efficiency and MEA thickness. You can then analyze this Pareto front to select the design that best meets your overall goals and priorities.

## Multi-Objective Optimization Problem for the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA)

Building on our validated electrochemical model, we revise the multi-objective optimization problem for the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) to align with minimizing specific energy consumption and physical size, while maximizing cell efficiency and membrane durability under realistic operating constraints. This formulation directly supports the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs cost and performance targets for PEM electrolysis by exploring inherently coupled trade-offs in the design space.

### New Objective Functions

The multi-objective optimization problem is to minimize the following two objectives:

#### Objective 1 ‚Äì Minimize Specific Energy Consumption (SEC)

The Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) in units of kWh/kg H‚ÇÇ is defined as the amount of electric energy required to produce 1 kg of hydrogen.

The general definition is:
$\text{SEC}(x) = \frac{V_{\text{cell}}(x) \cdot i}{\dot{m}_{H_2}(x)} \cdot \frac{1}{\eta_F} \cdot \frac{1}{\rho_{\text{cell}}},$

Breaking this into a more useful working formula using physical constants:

Mass flow rate of H‚ÇÇ per unit area:
$\dot{m}_{H_2}(x) = \frac{i \cdot 3600 \cdot MW_{H_2}}{2F}$

Energy input per hour per unit area:
$P_{\text{elec}} = V_{\text{cell}}(x) \cdot i$

Thus,
$\text{SEC}(x) = \frac{V_{\text{cell}}(x) \cdot i}{\dot{m}_{H_2}(x)} = \frac{2F \cdot V_{\text{cell}}(x)}{3600 \cdot MW_{H_2}}$

This yields the first objective function:
$f_1(x) = \text{SEC}(x) = \frac{2F \cdot V_{\text{cell}}(x)}{3600 \cdot MW_{H_2}} \quad \text{[kWh/kg-H}_2\text{]}$

where:
* $F = 96485$ C/mol (Faraday constant)
* $MW_{H_2} = 2.016 \times 10^{-3}$ kg/mol (Molar mass of Hydrogen)
* $V_{\text{cell}}(x)$ is the total cell voltage, defined via:
    $V_{\text{cell}}(x) = V_{oc}(T) + \Delta V_{\text{act}}(i, L_{\text{cat}}) + \Delta V_{\text{ohm}}(t_{\text{mem}}, t_{\text{el}}, i, T) + \Delta V_{\text{conc}}(i)$

#### Objective 2 ‚Äì Minimize Physical Size of the MEA

The MEA consists of the membrane electrolyte and the electrodes.
This objective function minimizes the **stack height** per cell, influencing compactness, heat transfer, mechanical design, and materials usage.
MEA thickness reflects: Material use ( cost), device compactness ( stack height), Mechanical and thermal performance.

$f_2(x)=t_{mem}+2 \cdot t_{el}$

$$f_2(x)=t_{MEA‚Äã(x)}=t_{mem}‚Äã+t_{anode,electode}‚Äã+t_{cathode,electrode}‚Äã$$
### Final Problem Summary

**Decision Variables:**
$x = \begin{bmatrix} t_{\text{mem}} \\ t_{\text{el}} \\ L_{\text{cat}} \\ i \\ T \end{bmatrix}$
where:
* $t_{\text{mem}}$: Membrane thickness
* $t_{\text{el}}$: Electrode thickness (assumed uniform for anode and cathode catalyst layers)
* $L_{\text{cat}}$: Catalyst loading (assumed uniform for anode and cathode)
* $i$: Current density
* $T$: Operating temperature

**Objectives:**
Minimize Specific Energy Consumption (SEC):
$f_1(x) = \frac{2F \cdot V_{\text{cell}}(x)}{3600 \cdot MW_{H_2}}$

Minimize Size of MEA (Area Required):
$f_2(x) = \frac{2F \cdot r_{H_2}^{\text{design}}}{3600 \cdot MW_{H_2} \cdot i}$

**Constraints:**
Gas-crossover limit: 

2.  **Mechanical durability of the membrane:**
    $g_2(x) = t_{\text{mech,min}} - t_{\text{mem}} \leq 0$
    where $t_{\text{mech,min}} = r \sqrt{\frac{k\,\Delta P\,SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}}$

3.  **Bounds on variables:**
    $t_{\text{mem,min}} \le t_{\text{mem}} \le t_{\text{mem,max}}$
    $t_{\text{el,min}} \le t_{\text{el}} \le t_{\text{el,max}}$
    $L_{\text{cat,min}} \le L_{\text{cat}} \le L_{\text{cat,max}}$
    $i_{\min} \le i \le i_{\text{lim}}$
    $T_{\min} \le T \le T_{\max}$



This multi-objective optimization problem will be solved using algorithms like NSGA-II to identify Pareto-optimal solutions, revealing the inherent trade-offs between specific energy consumption and MEA physical size.


**Future to include Active area integration with the cell thickness.**
The MEA area directly relates to the total H‚ÇÇ production capacity and current density:
$A_{\text{cell}} = \frac{r_{H_2}^{\text{design}} \cdot 2F}{i \cdot 3600 \cdot MW_{H_2}}$

Hence, for a fixed design production rate (e.g., 1 kg/h), the required MEA area becomes inversely proportional to the current density:
$f_2(x) = A_{\text{MEA}}(x) = \frac{2F \cdot r_{H_2}^{\text{design}}}{3600 \cdot MW_{H_2} \cdot i} \quad \text{[m}^2\text{]}$

This objective function minimizes the total membrane and catalyst area required, which reflects both cost (material footprint) and physical system size.

### 1. MEA Design Library

**Inputs:** Combinatorial set of MEA parameter tuples

* **Membrane:** thickness $t_{\rm mem}$, equivalent weight, water uptake
* **Catalyst layer:** loading $L_{\rm cat}$, porosity, tortuosity, ECSA
* **Electrode backing:** thickness $t_{\rm el}$, carbon-ionomer ratio
* **Operating point:** current density $i$, temperature $T$

Each design is one point in $\mathbb{R}^5$.

---

### 2. Detailed Multiphysics Model

**Objective functions:**
$\begin{cases} f_1(x)\;=\;\displaystyle\mathrm{SEC}(x)\;=\;\frac{2F\,V_{\rm cell}(x)}{3600\,MW_{H_2}} \\ f_2(x)\;=\;\;t_{\rm MEA}(x)\;=\;t_{\rm mem}+t_{\rm el} \end{cases}$

with
$V_{\rm cell}(x)=V_{oc}(T)+\Delta V_{\rm act}(i,L_{\rm cat})+\Delta V_{\rm ohm}(t_{\rm mem},t_{\rm el},i,T)+\Delta V_{\rm conc}(i)$

**Subject to:**

* **Mechanical durability:** $g_2(x)=t_{\rm mech,min}-t_{\rm mem}\le0$
* **Gas-crossover limit:** $\eta_F=1-\tfrac{i_{\rm cross}(x)}{i}\ge\eta_{F,\min}$
* **Bounds:** $t_{\rm mem}\in[t_{\rm mem,min},t_{\rm mem,max}],\;\dots$ (and similar bounds for $t_{\rm el}$, $L_{\rm cat}$, $i$, $T$)

This block solves the full set of coupled equations (Butler‚ÄìVolmer, Ohm‚Äôs law, mass-transport Nernst/limiting-current, mechanical stress) for each candidate design to yield $(f_1,f_2)$.

---

### 3. Surrogate (ANN) Model

Because each detailed simulation can take minutes, we train an ANN
$(x)\;\longmapsto\;\bigl(f_1(x),\,f_2(x),\,\eta_F(x)\bigr)$
on a representative sampling of the MEA library. The surrogate then predicts performance in milliseconds and even suggests near-optimal $x$ via gradient-based or evolutionary searches.

---

### 4. Pareto-Front Ranking & Optimal Designs

* Plot the surrogate-predicted Pareto front in the $(f_1,f_2)$ plane.
* Select a handful of ‚Äúknees‚Äù that best balance energy consumption vs. physical size.
* Validate the top 3‚Äì5 designs with the detailed model to ensure surrogate fidelity.

**Output for each winner:**

* MEA stack schematic (layer thicknesses)
* Operating conditions $(i,T)$
* Predicted SEC, size, Faraday efficiency

Here are key references supporting the optimization model and constraints for PEM electrolyzer design:

## Ohmic vs. Gas Crossover Trade-offs
**Membrane thickness ($t_{\text{mem}}$):**
* Thinner membranes reduce ionic resistance ($\eta_{\text{ohm}}=i\cdot t_{\text{mem}}/\kappa_{\text{mem}}$) but increase gas crossover ($J_{\text{crossover}}\propto D_{\text{gas}}/t_{\text{mem}}$) due to higher permeability. This inverse relationship is experimentally validated for Nafion‚Ñ¢ membranes [4](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/19/4/jcli3640.1.xml), [5](https://www.utdallas.edu/~jxz156730/Journals/JIE_2014_JEE_correlation.pdf).
* Optimal $t_{\text{mem}}$ balances ohmic losses (linear dependence) and gas-crossover losses (inversely proportional) [5](https://www.utdallas.edu/~jxz156730/Journals/JIE_2014_JEE_correlation.pdf).

## Activation Overpotential & Catalyst Loading
**Butler‚ÄìVolmer kinetics:**
* Higher catalyst loading ($L_{\text{cat}}$) reduces activation overpotential by increasing the active surface area, lowering the exchange current density ($i_0$) threshold [2](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/12/9687/2012/acp-12-9687-2012.pdf).
* Excess loading (>3 mg/cm¬≤) can impede mass transport, increasing concentration losses ($\eta_{\text{conc}}=-\frac{RT}{nF}\ln(1-i/i_L)$) [2](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/12/9687/2012/acp-12-9687-2012.pdf), [4](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/19/4/jcli3640.1.xml).

## Mechanical Durability Constraint
**Membrane thickness safety criterion:**
* The constraint $g_1(x)=r\sqrt{\frac{k\,\Delta P\,SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}}-t_{\text{mem}}\le0$ aligns with pinhole growth models under hydrostatic stress. For Nafion‚Ñ¢, tensile strength ($\sigma_{\text{tensile}}$) ranges 25‚Äì40 MPa, and safety factors ($SF$) of 1.5‚Äì2.0 are recommended for high-pressure differentials [3](https://schatzcenter.org/pubs/2020-OSW-R2.pdf).
* Swelling-induced plastic deformation accelerates failure at $\Delta P>20$ bar if $t_{\text{mem}}$ is insufficient [3](https://schatzcenter.org/pubs/2020-OSW-R2.pdf).

## Temperature Effects
**Operating temperature ($T$):**
* Elevated $T$ (e.g., 333‚Äì353 K) improves reaction kinetics but accelerates membrane degradation. Efficiency peaks near 60¬∞C due to trade-offs between proton conductivity and mechanical stability [1](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-I29-PURL-gpo59969/pdf/GOVPUB-I29-PURL-gpo59969.pdf), [3](https://schatzcenter.org/pubs/2020-OSW-R2.pdf).

For numerical implementation:
* Use COMSOL Multiphysics-validated ionic conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{mem}}$) models for Nafion‚Ñ¢ [4](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/19/4/jcli3640.1.xml).
* Reference gas permeability coefficients ($D_{\text{gas}}$) from high-pressure crossover experiments [5](https://www.utdallas.edu/~jxz156730/Journals/JIE_2014_JEE_correlation.pdf).
