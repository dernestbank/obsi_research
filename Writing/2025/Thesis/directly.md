In my methodology section for a journal article, I will rephrase the given text as follows:

The first and second exponential terms represent the contributions of oxidation and reduction currents, respectively. At high values of overpotentials, the reduction current is minimal which will allow the second exponential term to be neglected. Consequently, the Butler–Volmer equation can be simplified.

# PEM Electrochemical Module Mathematical Model

I will develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the PEM electrochemical module, incorporating both numerical and analytical equations, covering steady-state and transient models. The model will include the effects of overpotentials at the anode and cathode, the Nernst equation, Butler-Volmer equation, mass transport equations for hydrogen, oxygen, and water, as well as water crossover and Faraday's efficiency. Additionally, it will integrate geometric parameters, electrode parameters, and membrane properties, along with thermal effects and water management.

I will gather information from peer-reviewed journals, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to ensure an in-depth and accurate formulation of the model. I will notify you once the research is complete.

## 1. Electrochemical Equations

### Open-Circuit Voltage (Nernst Equation)
A PEM electrochemical cell’s reversible open-circuit voltage is given by the Nernst equation, which accounts for the reaction free energy and reactant/product activities. For the hydrogen–oxygen reaction:

\[
\text{H}_2 + \frac{1}{2} \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

The equilibrium potential \( E \) depends on temperature \( T \) and species activities (often approximated by partial pressures). At standard conditions (1 atm, 298 K) with liquid water product, \( E \approx 1.229 \) V.

\[
E_{\text{rev}} = E^0 + \frac{RT}{2F} \ln\left(\frac{a_{\text{H}_2} \sqrt{a_{\text{O}_2}}}{a_{\text{H}_2O}}\right)
\]

where \( E^0 \) is the standard potential (≈1.23 V for the PEM reaction), \( R \) is the gas constant, \( F \) is Faraday’s constant, and \( a_{i} \) are activities of H\(_2\), O\(_2\), and H\(_2\)O. For gases, \( a_{\text{gas}} \approx p_{\text{gas}} / p^0 \) (ratio of partial to standard pressure), and for liquid water, \( a_{\text{H}_2O} \approx 1 \) (if product is liquid water).

Temperature dependence enters through \( E^0(T) \); a more detailed form includes entropy change \( \Delta S \), as:

\[
E_{\text{rev}}(T) = E^0 + \frac{\Delta S}{2F}(T - 298~\text{K}) - \frac{RT}{2F} \ln(...)
\]

### Activation Overpotentials (Butler–Volmer Kinetics)
When current flows, the cell voltage drops due to kinetic activation losses at the anode and cathode. An activation overpotential \( \eta_{\text{act}} \) at each electrode drives the charge-transfer reaction by overcoming the electrochemical reaction barrier.

The Butler–Volmer equation relates the local reaction current density \( i \) (A/m²) to the overpotential at an electrode interface:

\[
i = i_0 \left[\exp\left(\frac{\alpha_a F \eta_{\text{act}}}{RT}\right) - \exp\left(\frac{-\alpha_c F \eta_{\text{act}}}{RT}\right)\right]
\]

Here, \( i_0 \) is the exchange current density, and \( \alpha_a, \alpha_c \) are anodic and cathodic charge transfer coefficients (often \( \alpha_a + \alpha_c \approx 1 \)).

For the hydrogen anode (which is usually fast), \( i_{0,\text{anode}} \) is large, so \( \eta_{\text{act,anode}} \) is small; for the oxygen cathode, \( i_{0,\text{cathode}} \) is much lower, so cathodic activation loss dominates.

For example, assuming a first-order dependence on \( O_2 \), a typical PEM cathode kinetics model is:

\[
i = i_{0,c} \left[\left(\frac{p_{\text{O}_2}}{p^0}\right)^{m} \exp\left(\frac{\alpha_c F \eta_{\text{cath}}}{RT}\right) - \exp\left(\frac{-(1-\alpha_c)F \eta_{\text{cath}}}{RT}\right)\right]
\]

where \( m \approx 0.5 \) accounts for the diatomic nature of \( O_2 \).

### Ohmic Losses
Ohmic overpotential \( \eta_{\text{ohm}} \) arises from resistive losses in the ionic and electronic conducting parts of the cell, primarily the membrane ionic resistance and the electronic resistances of electrodes and bipolar plates.

\[
\eta_{\text{ohm}} = i \left(\frac{t_{\text{mem}}}{\kappa_{\text{mem}}} + R_{\text{elec}}\right)
\]

where \( t_{\text{mem}} \) is membrane thickness, \( \kappa_{\text{mem}} \) is its conductivity (S/m), and \( R_{\text{elec}} \) lumps other resistances.

### Mass Transport (Concentration) Losses
At high current, reactant consumption can cause concentration gradients and depletion near the electrodes, leading to an additional overpotential:

\[
\eta_{\text{conc}} = -\frac{RT}{nF} \ln\left(1 - \frac{i}{i_L}\right)
\]

where \( n \) is electrons per reaction (2 for H\(_2\), 4 for O\(_2\) in PEMFC).

### Overall Cell Voltage
Combining all contributions, the instantaneous cell voltage under load is:

\[
V_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{rev}} - \eta_{\text{act, anode}} - \eta_{\text{act, cathode}} - \eta_{\text{ohm}} - \eta_{\text{conc}}
\]

For a stack of \( N_{\text{cell}} \) cells:

\[
V_{\text{stack}} = N_{\text{cell}} V_{\text{cell}}
\]

## 2. Faraday’s Efficiency (Fuel Utilization)
Faradaic efficiency \( \eta_F \) measures the fraction of the applied current that produces the target reaction products:

\[
\eta_F = \frac{\text{actual reaction current}}{\text{total current}} = 1 - \frac{i_{\text{loss}}}{i}
\]

where \( i_{\text{loss}} \) is the parasitic current density. If \( J_{\text{H}_2,\text{xover}} \) is the hydrogen crossover molar flux (mol/m²·s), then:

\[
i_{\text{xover}} = 2F J_{\text{H}_2,\text{xover}}
\]

Thus, Faraday efficiency is:

\[
\eta_F = 1 - \frac{i_{\text{xover}}}{i}
\]

## 3. Mass Transport Equations
### Continuity and Convection
For species \( k \), the conservation of mass equation is:

\[
\frac{\partial (\varepsilon \rho_k)}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\varepsilon \mathbf{u}\,\rho_k) = \nabla\cdot(\varepsilon D_{\text{eff},k}\nabla \rho_k) + S_k
\]

where \( \rho_k \) is the mass (or molar) density of species \( k \), \( \varepsilon \) is porosity, and \( \mathbf{u} \) is flow velocity.

### Diffusive Transport
Fick’s law gives the molar flux \( \mathbf{N}_i \) of species \( i \):

\[
\mathbf{N}_i = -D_{\text{eff},i} \nabla C_i
\]

where \( D_{\text{eff},i} \) is the effective diffusivity.
