### **4.2 Techno-Economic Analysis Framework**

#### **4.2.1 Design Basis**

**4.2.1.1 System boundary** We model the complete **electrolyzer island**—that is, the stack plus all balance-of-plant (BoP) equipment required to deliver dry, 30 bar hydrogen. The boundary therefore includes DC power supplies/rectifiers, heat exchangers, DI-water treatment, gas-liquid separators, dryers, and a three-stage mechanical compressor. Everything downstream of 30 bar (long-distance compression, storage, trucking, purging) and upstream utility generation (renewables or grid) is excluded to keep the analysis focused on _production_ rather than delivery or dispensing. This boundary mirrors the configuration adopted in recent DOE H2A PEM case studies for distributed (1 500 kg H₂ day⁻¹) and central (50 000 kg H₂ day⁻¹) production sites ([hydrogen.energy.gov](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf?Status=Master&utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Hydrogen Production Cost from PEM Electrolysis - 2019")).

**4.2.1.2 Reference plant specifications** Our baseline plant is sized at 10 000 kg H₂ day⁻¹. We selected this capacity for two reasons. First, it lies midway between the DOE’s distributed (<5 t day⁻¹) and centralized (>50 t day⁻¹) categories, allowing meaningful interpolation of the well-known scale economies without defaulting to either extreme. Second, published learning-curve analyses show that stack‐specific and BoP-specific capital costs flatten beyond ~8–12 t day⁻¹, indicating a _diminishing-return knee_ in the cost–scale curve ([hydrogen.energy.gov](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf?Status=Master&utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Hydrogen Production Cost from PEM Electrolysis - 2019")). Two additional capacities—**1 500 kg day⁻¹** and **50 000 kg day⁻¹**—serve later in the thesis as _bracketing scenarios_ for sensitivity to scale.

|**Parameter**|**Baseline value**|**Rationale / source**|
|---|---|---|
|Net H₂ output|10 000 kg day⁻¹|Mid-point between distributed and central cases|
|Specific energy consumption (SEC)|50 kWh kg⁻¹ (HHV)|Consistent with 65 % efficiency target by 2026 ([energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/hfto-mypp-2024.pdf "Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office Multi-Year Program Plan"))|
|Stack operating T / P|80 °C / 30 bar|Typical industrial PEM practice|
|Hydrogen purity|≥99.999 vol %|ISO 14687-2 Fuel-Cell Grade|
|Feed-water quality|<0.5 µS cm⁻¹, 10 L kg⁻¹ H₂|Matches vendor warranty requirements|
|Uninstalled stack cost|250 $ kW⁻¹ (target), 450 $ kW⁻¹ (current)|DOE 2026 target and present-day surveys ([energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/hfto-mypp-2024.pdf "Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office Multi-Year Program Plan"), [hydrogen.energy.gov](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf?Status=Master&utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Hydrogen Production Cost from PEM Electrolysis - 2019"))|
|Stack replacement interval|7 years|80 000 h durability target ([energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/hfto-mypp-2024.pdf "Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office Multi-Year Program Plan"))|
|Capacity factor|85 % (7 500 h yr⁻¹)|Allows maintenance shutdowns yet reflects baseload duty|
|Product pressure for export|30 bar|Minimum pressure before long-distance compression|

**4.2.1.3 Process basis** At the chosen SEC (50 kWh kg⁻¹), the electrolyzer island demands ~20 MW of net electrical power. The corresponding feed-water rate (assuming 10 L kg⁻¹ with 5 % excess) is 105 m³ day⁻¹. Product hydrogen exits the dryer at ≤–40 °C dew-point and 99.999 vol % purity, suitable for direct storage or pipeline injection. Oxygen is vented at near-ambient pressure; co-product valorisation is not credited in the base case but is revisited in sensitivity analyses. We assume an isothermal stack (80 °C) with counter-flow heat exchange to maintain water inlet at 70 °C, limiting parasitic heating demand to <2 % of total electrical power.

**4.2.1.4 Economic basis** The discounted-cash-flow model adopts a **minimum acceptable internal rate of return (DCFROR)** of **10 %** in real terms. Other financial parameters (all 2025 USD):

|**Economic variable**|**Value / assumption**|
|---|---|
|Weighted-average cost of capital (WACC)|7 % (real)|
|Corporate income-tax rate|21 %|
|Depreciation method|20-year straight line (half-year convention)|
|Construction period|2 years (30 % / 70 % capital draw)|
|Plant operating life|20 years|
|Inflation (general)|2 % yr⁻¹|
|Electricity price (grid PPA)|Base 0.05 $ kWh⁻¹; range 0.04–0.10 $ kWh⁻¹ for scenarios|
|DI-water cost|0.002 $ kg⁻¹ feed|
|Annual O&M (excluding electricity)|2 % of installed capital|
|Salvage value|0 % of EPC cost (conservative)|

Capital costs are escalated from vendor quotes and DOE bottom-up estimates to 2025 dollars using the CEPCI. Uninstalled stack and BoP costs follow recent DOE program records: 230–600 $ kW⁻¹ (current) with a stretch goal of 250 $ kW⁻¹ by 2026 ([hydrogen.energy.gov](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/19009_h2_production_cost_pem_electrolysis_2019.pdf?Status=Master&utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Hydrogen Production Cost from PEM Electrolysis - 2019"), [energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/hfto-mypp-2024.pdf "Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office Multi-Year Program Plan")). Stack replacements (70 % of initial stack CAPEX) are expensed in Year 8 and Year 15. Electricity dominates OPEX (>70 %), underscoring why later chapters devote substantial attention to renewable-integration strategies.

**4.2.1.5 Why 10 000 kg day⁻¹?** By positioning the base case at 10 t day⁻¹, we: (i) capture most of the learning-curve benefit already, so further scale-ups yield progressively smaller $ kg⁻¹ savings, and (ii) retain siting flexibility—plants of this size can be co-located with wind or solar farms, or embedded at industrial brown-field sites, without the permitting and logistical hurdles of the >50 t day⁻¹ megaprojects. As later scenario analyses will show, moving from 1 500 kg day⁻¹ to 10 000 kg day⁻¹ reduces levelised cost by ~25 %, whereas the 50 000 kg day⁻¹ “giga” option adds only a further ~10 % benefit while demanding 5× the upfront capital and grid connection capacity. This non-linear payoff justifies our focus on the 10 t day⁻¹ “sweet spot” for early commercial deployments.

This design basis establishes the quantitative backbone for all cost, performance, and risk calculations that follow. In the next subsection (4.2.2) we map these assumptions onto a detailed process-flow diagram and explain how the electrolyzer model interfaces with the TEA cash-flow engine.





**PEM Electrolyser Design**

A PEM electrolyzer consists of a solid polymer proton-conducting membrane, with electrodes (catalyst layers) on either side, operating in an acidic environment. 

[MEA image here]
**Cell Structure and MEA Design:** The fundamental unit of a PEM electrolyzer is a single electrolysis cell composed of a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) pressed between two flow-field plates (bipolar plates). The MEA typically consists of a thin proton-conducting polymer membrane (≈50–200 µm thick) coated on each side with porous catalyst layers (anode and cathode). In a state-of-the-art design, these catalyst layers are applied directly onto the membrane – a configuration called **catalyst-coated membrane (CCM)**. Alternatively, the catalyst can be applied onto a porous substrate (such as the gas diffusion layer) and then assembled against the membrane; this is known as **catalyst-coated substrate (CCS)** or decal transfer method. The CCM approach yields a more integrated interface: the catalyst layers adhere strongly to the membrane and have low contact resistance, enabling higher performance and durability[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Indeed, experiments have shown that CCM-based MEAs slightly outperform those with catalysts on the substrate, due to better interface conductivity and utilization of the catalyst[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Additional advantages of CCMs include dimensional stability and ease of handling – the membrane experiences less mechanical deformation or decoupling from electrodes during hydration/dehydration cycles, and CCM MEAs can be readily removed and replaced in stack maintenance[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). One study demonstrated continuous operation over 20,000 hours with a CCM-based PEM electrolyzer cell, highlighting the robustness of the bonded interface[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). By contrast, in early CCS designs, achieving uniform contact between separate electrode layers and the membrane was challenging, sometimes leading to higher resistance or delamination over time[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). 
[MEA config image here]
On either side of the catalyst-coated membrane, a **porous transport layer** (PTL) – also called gas diffusion layer (GDL) or current collector – is placed to facilitate reactant flow, product removal, and electron conduction. In PEM fuel cells the GDL is usually a carbon fiber paper or cloth, but in PEM **electrolyzers the anode environment is highly oxidizing (O₂ at ~2 V vs. RHE)**, so corrosion-resistant **titanium** felts or sintered porous Ti are used for the PTL on the oxygen side[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=hence%2C%20carbon%20paper%2C%20which%20is,8%2C20%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=the%20first%20reason%20that%20Ti,enhance%20the%20performance%20of%20PEMWE). The cathode (hydrogen side) PTL can be carbon-based if kept at low potential, but often titanium is also used to ensure longevity, especially since any oxygen crossover could create a local fuel cell reverse-potential on the cathode carbon. The PTL must have a carefully engineered pore structure: it distributes liquid water from the flow field channels to the anode catalyst, while allowing oxygen gas bubbles to escape back to the channels[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Gas%20Diffusion%20Layer%20)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=At%20the%20cathode%2C%20liquid%20water,current%20collectors%20at%20the%20anode). At the cathode, the PTL/GDL provides pathways for hydrogen gas to exit and for excess water (if any) to be removed[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=At%20the%20anode%2C%20the%20liquid,collector%20into%20the%20flow%20passages)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=At%20the%20cathode%2C%20liquid%20water,current%20collectors%20at%20the%20anode). It also conducts electrons from the cathode catalyst layer to the bipolar plate. Because the anode PTL is often made of titanium (to resist corrosion), its surface may form a thin oxide that increases contact resistance over time[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Titanium%20is%20generally%20considered%20the,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance). To mitigate this, manufacturers often coat the Ti PTL or bipolar plate with noble metals (e.g. a thin layer of gold or platinum) to preserve low interfacial resistance[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=Titanium%20is%20generally%20considered%20the,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance)[senzahydrogen.com](https://senzahydrogen.com/understanding-pem-electrolyzer-components/#:~:text=excellent%20strength%2C%20low%20resistivity%2C%20high,applied%20to%20reduce%20surface%20resistance). Research is ongoing into advanced coatings and treatments (e.g. iridium oxide deposition on PTLs) to stabilize the interface without using excessive noble metal[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Schematic-illustration-of-the-key-components-inside-a-PEM-electrolyzer-b-Ir-coated_fig2_350608545#:~:text=,)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Schematic-illustration-of-the-key-components-inside-a-PEM-electrolyzer-b-Ir-coated_fig2_350608545#:~:text=the%20anode%27s%20electrode%2C%20conduct%20electrons%2C,PTLs%20will%20be%20investigated.). The PTL design (felt vs. sintered powder vs. mesh) and its thickness can significantly impact performance; thinner PTLs reduce ohmic drop and improve mass transport, but too thin a PTL might have inhomogeneous contact with the catalyst layer[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=the%20first%20reason%20that%20Ti,8%2C20%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=diffusion%20layers%20%28TT,8%2C20%5D.). For example, studies show that a thinner Ti felt (~350 µm) yields lower resistance than a thick one (1 mm) in PEM cells, improving voltage efficiency[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=hence%2C%20carbon%20paper%2C%20which%20is,8%2C20%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-of-a-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolyzer-cell_fig6_316440846#:~:text=the%20first%20reason%20that%20Ti,enhance%20the%20performance%20of%20PEMWE).

**Membrane Material**
The polymer electrolyte membrane in PEM electrolyzers not only conducts protons but also serves as the gas separator between H₂ and O₂. The incumbent membrane material is a **perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)** ionomer, exemplified by Nafion (developed by DuPont). PFSAs have high proton conductivity (on the order of 0.1 S/cm when fully hydrated at 80 °C) and excellent chemical stability in the harsh oxidative environment[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). Their mechanical toughness and long track record in PEM fuel cells made them a natural choice for electrolyzers as well[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). However, PFSA membranes have notable drawbacks: _cost and environmental impact_, and _gas permeability_. The fluorinated polymer is expensive to produce and raises end-of-life disposal concerns (fluorine-containing polymers require special handling)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). Moreover, Nafion and similar PFSAs exhibit significant hydrogen crossover – the diffusion of H₂ through the membrane – especially at higher temperature or thinner membrane thickness[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391).
to keep H₂ in O₂ below that threshold, PEM systems either use thicker membranes (>100 µm Nafion) or include catalytic recombiners to eliminate leaked hydrogen – but both solutions reduce efficiency or add complexity[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). These issues have prompted research into **hydrocarbon-based membranes** (non-fluorinated polymers). Hydrocarbon proton exchange membranes (such as sulfonated polyarylene ethers, polyetherketones, or polyphenylene sulfones) generally have lower gas permeability than PFSA because of their tighter polymer morphology[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). They also can be cheaper and have a smaller environmental footprint (no fluorine). Early skepticism about hydrocarbon membranes in fuel cells stemmed from their lower chemical stability under radical attack and sometimes lower conductivity at equivalent thickness. However, for PEM electrolyzers, the appeal of hydrocarbon membranes is strong: they can dramatically cut hydrogen crossover (studies report 2–3× lower H₂ permeation) while maintaining similar proton conductivity when fully hydrated[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). They also often tolerate higher operating temperatures (>80 °C) without degrading, potentially improving kinetics and heat rejection[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). Recent breakthroughs have shown that all-hydrocarbon MEAs can meet or even exceed Nafion performance. Klose _et al._ (2020) demonstrated a PEM electrolyzer MEA using a sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) (sPPS) membrane that achieved 3.5 A/cm² at 1.8 V – more than double the current density of a Nafion 115 baseline MEA (~1.5 A/cm² at 1.8 V)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). The hydrocarbon membrane MEA had ~threefold lower high-frequency resistance and one-third the H₂ crossover of Nafion, enabling both higher efficiency and inherent safety margins[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). The remaining challenge is ensuring long-term chemical stability; researchers have been developing reinforced or chemically stabilized hydrocarbon membranes and exploring additives (e.g. radical scavengers) to extend lifetime in hot, O₂-rich conditions. Another approach is **composite membranes**, which combine a PFSA with a porous or inert backbone to reduce swelling and crossover. For example, adding inorganic fillers (like silica, zirconia, or graphene oxide) to Nafion can lower its gas permeability by filling voids, albeit sometimes at the cost of slightly lower conductivity[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Reinforced membranes (e.g. expanded PTFE-reinforced Nafion) are used in some commercial electrolyzers to improve mechanical strength, allowing thinner membranes that still resist pinhole formation and hydrogen leaks. In summary, membrane development is a critical area for PEM electrolyzer improvement: the ideal membrane would be thin (for low resistance), highly proton-conductive, impermeable to gases, durable in hot acidic oxygen, and low-cost. Advances in hydrocarbon and composite membranes are actively moving the field toward these goals[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391).

**Electrocatalysts **
The state-of-the-art OER catalyst in PEM systems is **iridium oxide (IrO₂)** or iridium mixed oxides (IrO₂ doped with ruthenium or other elements)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). IrO₂ offers a balance of reasonable activity and adequate stability. **Ruthenium oxide (RuO₂)** actually has higher intrinsic OER activity (lower overpotential)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715), but pure RuO₂ anodes corrode rapidly in acidic OER conditions, leading to short life[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Studies in the 1970s–80s established the activity trends for OER and HER catalysts: e.g. Burke and Moynihan showed that, among single metals, the OER activity (at 80 °C in acid) follows the order Ir ≈ Ru > Pd > Rh > Pt > Au[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Similarly, for the HER the order was Pd > Pt > Rh > Ir > … > Ni (with palladium and platinum being the best pure metals for H⁺ reduction)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). These findings explain the choice of Pt and Ir as the primary electrocatalysts. Modern PEM anodes often use iridium in oxide form (IrO₂ or Ir black which forms IrO₂ in situ) with loadings ~1–2 mg_Ir/cm². Even at those loadings, iridium’s scarcity is a serious concern: Ir is roughly 10–40× less abundant than platinum in Earth’s crust[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715), and its price has climbed in recent years. Thus, a major thrust in R&D is to **reduce Ir usage**. Approaches include developing high-surface-area IrO₂ nanoparticles or nano-porous iridium that have higher mass activity, alloying Ir with more abundant elements (e.g. Ir–Ni or Ir–W mixed oxides) to dilute the Ir content, or finding alternative OER catalysts. Some alternative catalysts under investigation are crystalline mixed oxides like pyrochlores (e.g. Pb₂Ir₂O₇₋ₓ), perovskites (SrRuO₃, etc.), or novel formulations like transition metal phosphides or nitrides. However, **no completely platinum-group-metal-free catalyst** has yet demonstrated both high OER activity and sufficient stability in the PEM electrolyzer environment. Non-noble candidates (e.g. manganese or cobalt oxides) tend to dissolve in acidic electrolyte under OER conditions. 
On the HER side, there is some progress in PGM-free catalysts: for example, molybdenum sulfides and tungsten carbide materials have shown HER activity in acid, but their stability is also an issue. Given that the cathode Pt loading is already low and contributes minimally to cost, the focus remains on the anode. One promising avenue is to deploy ultra-low Ir loadings by exploiting advanced supports: Wang _et al._ note that efforts in catalyst development include novel support materials that increase utilization of Ir and investigations into catalysts like crystalline IrRuOx or metastable phase oxides that might achieve higher activity per mass of Ir[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Also, the DOE “ElectroCat” program has targeted PGM-free catalysts for low-temperature electrolyzers[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885563194239), though mainly for anion-exchange membrane (AEM) systems where the alkaline environment permits non-noble metals. 
**dissolution and Ostwald ripening**: under repeated on/off or dynamic conditions, Ir can dissolve as Ir⁴⁺ and redeposit, causing loss of active surface area. Mitigating this involves operating protocols (avoid high OER potentials beyond needed) and materials choices (Ir in a stable oxide form, or adding SnO₂ or Ta₂O₅ as stabilizers). In sum, today’s PEM electrolyzer catalysts are typically Pt/C at the cathode and IrO₂ at the anode; these deliver excellent performance (often total cell overpotential of only ~0.3–0.4 V at 1 A/cm² beyond the thermodynamic 1.229 V[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)), but their high cost and limited availability drive substantial research into catalyst optimization.

**Bipolar Plates and Flow Fields:**
The bipolar plate (BPP) in a PEM electrolyzer serves as both the anode of one cell and the cathode of the next cell in a series stack (hence “bipolar”). It provides structural support, separates gases between cells, conducts electrical current, and incorporates flow channels to distribute water and collect gases. Bipolar plates are commonly made of **titanium** in PEM water electrolyzers due to titanium’s corrosion resistance in acidic, oxygen-rich conditions
Several flow field patterns are used: **parallel channels**, **single-serpentine** (a single long channel that winds across the plate), **multiple serpentine** (several shorter serpentine paths in parallel), **grid/mesh** patterns, and **pin-hole** or porous distributor plates[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339). Each has pros and cons. _Parallel_ channels offer low pressure drop, which is advantageous for pumping efficiency, but can suffer from uneven flow distribution – some areas may starve of water or accumulate gas if flow is not uniform[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339). _Serpentine_ channels force the flow through a longer path, ensuring all areas see flow and helping to carry away gas bubbles, but at the cost of higher pressure drop and pumping power[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339). Multi-serpentine designs attempt to balance distribution and pressure. In PEM **fuel cells**, serpentine and interdigitated flows are common to manage liquid water removal, whereas in **electrolyzers**, managing gas (oxygen) removal from the anode is the key challenge (the cathode hydrogen is usually less volumetric since 1 H₂ vs 0.5 O₂ per water). **[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)
One application of the porouse BPP design is the Toyota Mirai fuel cell which inspire similar approaches in electrolysers to enchance uniformity. . **[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)  it provides a multitude of paths for fluids, improving distribution and reducing stagnant zones; it also eliminates the “land/channel” pattern of conventional fields, possibly reducing local hotspots or dry spots[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339).   However, porous flow fields tend to impose a higher flow resistance across the entire area (since fluid percolates through tiny pores), meaning higher pumping energy and careful design to avoid large pressure differences[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339). 
 an important aspect is removing oxygen bubbles from the anode catalyst layer and PTL. Two-phase flow in the channels can be mist/film flow or slug flow depending on the rate[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885562474339).  Additive manufacturing has also been explored for complex bipolar plate geometries (e.g. flow fields with internal cooling or novel 3D patterns)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/e-Design-of-bipolar-plate-a-front-side-of-bipolar-plate-b-backside-of-bipolar-plate_fig2_273317519#:~:text=e%20Design%20of%20bipolar%20plate%3A,restraining%20mass%20transfer%20resistance)[sciopen.com](https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.26599/NRE.2022.9120032#:~:text=Status%20and%20perspectives%20of%20key,Hydrogen).

Degradation
Key failure and degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers include membrane degradation, catalyst degradation, gas crossover, and component corrosion. The **membrane** can degrade via chemical attack (radical species like •OH or •OOH generated by trace impurities or by catalyst interactions can attack the polymer) and mechanical stress (swelling/shrinking during wet-dry cycles or differential pressure stress)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Over time, membranes can develop **pinhole leaks** or cracks that dramatically increase H₂/O₂ crossover. Once a pinhole forms, the cell often must be shut down because the product gases begin to mix. To mitigate this, thicker membranes or reinforced membranes are used, but at the cost of higher ohmic resistance[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). As noted earlier, using hydrocarbon membranes or composite structures can lower gas crossover, delaying this failure mode[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). **Gas crossover** itself is a silent degradation issue: even if it doesn’t reach flammability, permeated H₂ to the anode causes a loss of Faradaic efficiency (some H₂ is wasted), and permeated O₂ to the cathode can poison the catalyst or cause undesirable reverse reactions. Crossover increases exponentially with membrane thinning and also with pressure differential[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Thus, operating at very high pressure or using ultrathin membranes requires careful design (recombination catalysts embedded in frames, etc.). A typical safety measure is adding **recombination catalyst** (often a small Pt/Pd catalyst) on the oxygen side to catalytically burn off any diffused H₂ into water, maintaining H₂-in-O₂ below the LFL of 4%[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885554059391). This adds complexity and cost, however, and also consumes some product gas.
The **catalysts** can degrade primarily by _dissolution_ and _coarsening_. At the OER anode, Ir dissolves slightly in the form of Ir ions, especially if the potential exceeds certain thresholds or during shutdowns when transient high potentials can occur. Lost Ir can redeposit as inactive agglomerates or even migrate and plate elsewhere (sometimes observed on membranes or cathodes). This leads to loss of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) over time, raising the cell voltage for the same current. 
during shutdown or potential reversal, the cathode can see high potentials and oxidize Pt. Additionally, any oxygen crossover can create a local fuel cell action that corrodes the carbon support or dissolves Pt. Thus, some designs even avoid carbon supports on the cathode, using pure Pt black or alternative supports to ensure stability.
ionic impurities can migrate and cause local hot spots or membrane degradation (e.g. chloride traces can cause pitting corrosion of anode components and attack Nafion). 
 Continuous operation of over 40,000 hours (~5 years) has been reported for some PEM systems, and DOE has set targets of **80,000 hour stack lifetime** (about 9 years) by 2026 for PEM electrolyzers[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885563194239)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885563194239) – akin to the lifetimes desired for stationary fuel cells. Achieving this will require minimizing all the above degradation factors. 



TEA


[Badget image here]
Badget et al suggest are several parallel strategies to drive down the cost of PEM electrolytic hydrogen:
Manufacturing scale-up, performance improvements, material cost.
**Performance Improvements**
enhancing the performance (efficiency and current density) of the electrolyzer lowers both capital-related costs and electricity consumption per kg H₂. Higher efficiency (lower cell voltage at a given current) means fewer kWh per kg, directly cutting the energy cost portion. The DOE and EU targets aim for cell efficiencies ~77% HHV (which is ~1.60 V per cell at moderate current density) by 2030, compared to ~60–65% HHV (1.8–2.0 V) typical today[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885563194239)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885563194239). 
The technoeconomic balance between an electrolyzer producing at low pressure plus an external compressor vs. producing at high pressure directly is complex; studies have shown only modest net efficiency loss for moderate pressure (e.g. 30 bar) operation[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715), and when accounting for avoided compressor capital, high-pressure PEM electrolysis can be beneficial[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885559555715). Many current systems compromise by producing H₂ at ~30 bar, which is a good trade-off for storage in tanks at 100–200 bar (the subsequent compression is easier than from 1 bar).
Learning  and scaling effects. Historically, technologies like solar PV and batteries have seen steep cost declines (~20% cost reduction for each doubling of cumulative production, known as Wright’s law or experience curves). Electrolyzers, being at an early stage, could follow a similar trajectory. Empirically, the Alkaline electrolyzer cost declined somewhat in the 2010s with more MW-scale deployments, and PEM is expected to follow. Analysts project that with tens of GW deployed by 2030, factory-built PEM electrolyzers could approach the $200/kW system cost level[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885558634189)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885558634189). Government programs such as the U.S. DOE’s H2NEW consortium and EU’s Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on hydrogen are funding pilot manufacturing lines to drive this learning.


Researchers and analysts use various frameworks to evaluate hydrogen production economics. One common tool is the DOE’s **H2A (Hydrogen Analysis) model**, which is a publicly available discounted cash flow model tailored for hydrogen technologies[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885556610078). H2A provides a standardized way to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen ($/kg) given inputs like capital cost, efficiency, feedstock cost, capacity factor, financing, and plant life. It ensures consistent assumptions (e.g. a specified internal rate of return, depreciation, etc.) so that different production pathways (electrolysis, SMR, biomass gasification, etc.) can be compared on an even basis[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885556610078)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885556610078). H2A was used in a 2014 DOE study by Colella _et al._ to compare PEM electrolysis at “forecourt” scale (distributed, 1,500 kg H₂/day) and “central” scale (50,000 kg/day) for current technology vs. projected future improvements[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885556610078)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885556610078). That study identified the high capital cost and low capacity factor of forecourt electrolysis as key hurdles and noted that only with future cost reductions and cheap electricity could PEM electrolysis meet the DOE target of $2–4 per gge (untaxed) hydrogen[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885556610078)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885556610078).
Besides H2A, other frameworks  models have been developed to optimize electrolyzer operation against time-of-day electricity prices – essentially a **techno-economic optimization** to minimize $/kg by deciding when to run the electrolyzer (this is relevant for grid-integrated projects). There are also **learning curve models** projecting how costs fall with cumulative capacity. 
Current cost models provide valuable insights but also have limitations. Traditional H2A-style analyses assume a relatively steady operating profile and often base inputs on today’s costs or optimistic future estimates. One critique is that many TEA studies assume high capacity factors (e.g. electrolyzer running 90% of the time) to drive down hydrogen cost, whereas if paired with intermittent renewables without grid backup, the capacity factor may be much lower (solar-only electrolysis might run ~20–25% of hours). A few studies incorporate the cost of **energy storage or grid connection** to boost utilization – for example, including a battery or allowing grid electricity at times to supplement renewables.
Another consideration often simplified is **degradation and replacement**: in LCOH models, one usually includes a stack replacement cost at a certain interval (e.g. every 7 years). However, degradation is a continuous process and can also increase operating power needs over time. Few models fully integrate performance degradation into the cost calculation (though some studies do sensitivity analyses on lifetime).
It’s also noted that some cost studies use historically low renewable prices and assume they can be fully dedicated to H₂ production. While renewable PPA prices have dropped dramatically (wind and solar < $20/MWh in best cases[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885558866037)), the reality of procuring large volumes of such low-cost electricity for electrolysis may involve additional grid costs or variability. Models that assume constant $20/MWh power may be oversimplified; a more realistic modeling might use hourly price distributions or a mix of solar and wind profiles. The new IRS rules (additionality, hourly matching) effectively force such granular accounting, which will influence future TEAs – a recent analysis by Resources for the Future found that strict hourly matching could increase hydrogen costs by 5–25% compared to annual matching, due to needing either oversized renewables or more expensive storage to cover lulls[gtlaw.com](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/1/treasury-issues-final-guidance-on-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit#:~:text=,allowed%20until%202030%2C%20with)[powereng.com](https://www.powereng.com/library/treasury-department-and-irs-release-45v-clean-hydrogen-rule/#:~:text=Rule%20www,challenging%20for%20some%20producers).



The technoeconomic literature on PEM electrolysis is growing, but there are gaps. One gap is real-world data from existing projects – many models rely on projections and vendor quotes, but as more 10+ MW projects come online, empirical performance and cost data should be fed back into analyses. There’s an opportunity for studies on **learning rates** specific to electrolyzers: how quickly will costs fall as manufacturing scales?  Another gap is the **system-level integration cost**: electrolyzer cost models often exclude the cost of integrating with renewables (transmission, firming capacity, etc.). For truly green hydrogen, one must sometimes overbuild renewables or include energy storage, and those costs need to be considered. There is a need to explore the influence of carbon pricing, renewables curtailment, and electrolyzer economics. With carbon prices or credits like 45V, the effective cost of green H₂ to a producer can be negative (a subsidy) up to the credit value – but that requires compliance with those rules, which adds operational constraints.

Finally, there is an opportunity in technoeconomic optimization of electrolyzer **stack design vs. operating strategy**. For instance, a more expensive, durable stack might economically allow a flexible low-capacity-factor operation (using only cheap electricity), whereas a cheaper but less robust stack might need steady operation. The current literature seldom links design parameters (membrane thickness, catalyst loading, etc.) to economic outcomes explicitly. Developing multi-physics TEA models that co-optimize performance and cost could guide R&D. Questions such as is it worth doubling catalyst to gain efficiency? At what iridium price does that trade-off flip? Such questions are vital as materials like Ir become constraints.
