The design and assembly of the PEM Electrolyser cell is described and the method of implementing the RE is described in detail

## 3.1 Electrolyzer and Electrochemical Module

The core of PEM electrolysis is the science of splitting water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. 
$$ H_{2}O -> H_{2}+ 1/2O_{2} \tag{1}$$
The reaction is completed in two half cells. First, the catalyst at anode initiates the Oxygen evolution reaction(OER) to generate the protons($H^+$). 
$$H_{2}O_{(l)} \rightarrow 1/2 O_{2}{(g)} + 2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \tag{2}$$ The protons  migrates to the cathode half cell to be reduced through an Hydrogen Evolution reaction to generate Hydrogen molecules.
$$2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \rightarrow  H_{2}{(g)} \tag{3} $$
It is an endothermic reaction since the difference in the energies of formation of the products and reactant are positive. The enthalpy of the reaction is the contribution of both the electrical and thermal energy though the former is dominant for low temperature electrolytic systems (< $100 ^oC$) . Contrary for high temperature electrolytic systems that operates between 700 ¬∞C and 1000 ¬∞C  such as in SOEC the reaction is driven by the heat supplied and hence consumes less electricity. @coriglianoTechnologySolidOxide2022
$$\Delta H = \Delta G + T\cdot \Delta S \tag{4}$$
For the cell to overcome the resistance to flow of protons, additional potential will need to be generated. The total cell voltage required for the electrochemical reaction is the sum of the ideal voltage and the total overpotentials generated from the design of the cells.  The overpotential is the contribution from the electrode and electrolyte materials. @bessarabovPEMElectrolysisHydrogen2016

Theoretically, the minimum voltage required to initiate the reaction under ideal conditions without any energy loses is:  $$ V_{rev}= \dfrac{\Delta G}{2F} = 1.23 \tag{5} $$
Whereas the voltage required to drive the electrochemical reaction at a constant temperature where the heat generated by the reaction exactly balances the heat required by the reaction is the thermoneutral voltage and is given as: $$ V_{th}= \frac {\Delta H}{zF}=1.48V \tag{6}$$

### The Open circuit / reversible voltage
The Nernst equation relates the system temperature and pressure thus the reversible open-circuit voltage.  At standard conditions (1 atm, 298 K) with liquid water product, $V \approx 1.229$ V @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . 
$$
V_{\text{rev}} = V^0_{rev} + \frac{RT}{2F} \ln\left(\frac{a_{\text{H}_2} \sqrt{a_{\text{O}_2}}}{a_{\text{H}_2O}}\right) \tag{7}
$$

where $E^0$ is the standard potential ($\approx 1.23$ V for the PEM reaction), $R$ is the gas constant, $F$ is Faraday‚Äôs constant, and $a_i$ are the activities of $\text{H}_2$, $\text{O}_2$, and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. 
For gases, $a_{\text{gas}} \approx \frac{p_{\text{gas}}}{p^0}$ (ratio of partial to standard pressure) and for liquid water $a_{\text{H}_2O} \approx 1$. 
$${V_{rev} = V_{rev}^{0} + \frac{RT}{2GF}\ln\left(\frac{p_{H_{2}} \cdot p_{O_{2}}}{\alpha_{H_{2}O}}\right)} \tag{8}$$
 The partial pressures of the products, hydrogen $ùëù_{ùêª_{2}}$ and oxygen $ùëù_{ùëÇ_{2}}$ , are 0.53 and 0.47 bar respectfully.   The reversible voltage at STP is related as @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 :
$$V_{rev}^{0} = 1.229-0.09 \times 10^{-3}(T-298.0) \tag{9}$$ 
Pressure has a lesser effect on the $V_{r}$ than temperature due to the logarithmic term. Therefore, increasing hydrogen or oxygen pressure raises the open-circuit voltage, while accumulating product water (e.g., vapor) lowers it. Temperature dependence enters through $V^0(T)$, with a more detailed form including entropy change $\Delta S$:


### Activation Overpotentials 
There is a drop in voltage when current flows between the two half cells due to kinetic inefficiencies. The drop is characterized by the Butler Volmer equation as the activation overpotential. The activation overpotential ($V_{act}$ ) arises from the energy needed to drive a slow reaction step. The  reaction at the anode half cell limits the kinetics and is the main factor in the total activation overpotential whereas the faster kinetic at the cathode is influenced by the Pt/C catalyst‚Äã. @awasthiDynamicModelingSimulation2011 


When the reaction reaches a steady state, the current flowing at the anode and cathode is the same, this is the exchange current density ($i_{0}$‚Äã) and is mainly a function of the design material used. 
The exchange current density($i_o$,)   $i_{o,an} =K_{io, an}.exp‚Å°(\frac {E_{act,an}}{R.T})$ is referenced to the pre-exponential factor ($K_{i_o}$) as $21600000A/cm^2$ and the activation energy  ($E_{act,anode}$) as 76,000 J/mol. [@crespiExperimentalTheoreticalEvaluation2023]  



$$
i = i_0 \left[ \exp\left(\frac{\alpha_a zF V_{\text{act}}}{RT}\right) - \exp\left(\frac{-\alpha_c zF V_{\text{act}}}{RT}\right) \right] \tag{10}
$$
 $\alpha_a$, $\alpha_c$ are anodic and cathodic charge transfer coefficients ( $\alpha_a= 2.0$ $\alpha_c= 0.5$ ) and applies to both anode (hydrogen oxidation) and cathode (oxygen reduction) reaction @marangioDirectHighPressure2009; @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . 
 
The oxygen anode, $i_{0,\text{anode}}$ is many orders lower than $i_{0,\text{cathode}}$, so the anode activation loss becomes dominitate. [@espinosa-lopezModellingExperimentalValidation2018] [@garcia-valverdeSimplePEMWater2012]. Enhancing the anode exchange current density ($i_0$‚Äã) to effectually speed up the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can minimize the overpotential ($V_{act,anode}$) . Exchange current density and activation energy values for cathode and anode reactions are reported in <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Apendix</mark>.

In practice, separate Butler‚ÄìVolmer expressions is written for each electrode including reactant concentrations.
$$V_{act} = V_{act,a} + V_{act,c} \tag{11}$$
$$
V_{act,a} = \frac{RT_a}{\alpha_a F}\text{sinh}^{-1}\left(\frac{i}{2i_{0,a}}\right) = \frac{RT_a}{\alpha_a F}\ln\left(\frac{i}{2i_{0,a}} + \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{i}{2i_{0,a}}\right)^2}\right) \quad (12)
$$

$$
V_{act,c} = \frac{RT_c}{\alpha_c F}\text{sinh}^{-1}\left(\frac{i}{2i_{0,c}}\right) = \frac{RT_c}{\alpha_c F}\ln\left(\frac{i}{2i_{0,c}} + \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{i}{2i_{0,c}}\right)^2}\right) \quad (13)
$$
$V_{act,a}$ ,$V_{act,c}$ $T_a$ and $T_c$ are the anode and cathode voltage  the anode and cathode operating temperature respectively. 

At high anodic overpotential, the equation can be simplified to the Tafel equation:

$$
V_{\text{act,anode}} \approx \frac{RT}{\alpha_a F} \ln\left(\frac{i}{i_0}\right) \tag{14}
$$

For further simplification, the Butler-Volmer can also be expressed as,

$$
V_{act} = \frac{RT}{z\alpha_aF} \cdot \ln(i) - \frac{RT}{z\alpha_aF} \cdot \ln(i_0) = a \cdot \ln(i) - b \tag{15}
$$
The Tafel constant (b) helps measure the exchange current density ($i_o$ ), while the Tafel slope (a)¬†indicates the slowest step in the electrode reaction pathway @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 


### Ohmic Losses
Ohmic overpotential $V_{\text{ohm}}$ generates from resistive losses in the ionic and electronic conducting parts of the cell.  Ohmic loss is  modeled by Ohm‚Äôs law:
$$
V_{\text{ohm}} = i \cdot R_{\text{total}}= V_{ohm,a} + V_{ohm,c} + V_{ ohm,m} \tag{16}
$$
where $I$ is the cell current and $R_{\text{total}}$ is the total internal resistance that oppose the flow of the electrons. The total resistance is a function from the membrane electrolyte $R_{m}$, porous-electrode (GDL + CL)  layers $R_{elec}$ , interfacial contact resistance $R_{in}$ , and the resistance from the bipolar plates $R_{bpp}$ . 

$$R_{total} = R_{a}+ R_{c} + R_{m} = (R_{bpp,a} + R_{elec,a} + R_{in,a}) + (R_{bpp,c} + R_{elec,c}+ R_{in,c}) +R_m \tag{17}$$     
The resistance of the membrane is:
$$
R_{m} = \dfrac{t_{m}}{\sigma_{m}\,A}
\tag{18}
$$

where $t_m$ is membrane thickness thickness in micrometers (¬µm)  $\sigma_m$ is the proton conductivity of the  material used in Siemens per centimeter (S/cm). 
The membrane conductivity is modeled as a function of the temperature and water content. @leeThreeDimensionalTransportModeling2008   A membrane's hydration ($Œª$ )informs the ionic conductivity $\sigma_{\text{mem}}$ as  @springerPolymerElectrolyteFuel1991
$$
\sigma_{\text{mem}} = \left(0.0051392\lambda - 0.0005326\right) \cdot \exp\left(1.268 \left(\frac{1}{303} - \frac{1}{T}\right)\right)
\tag{19}
$$
and is valid for 5‚â§Œª‚â§22 and 30‚ÄØ¬∞C‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ_T_‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ120‚ÄØ¬∞C . 
A well-hydrated membrane has high $\sigma$ (e.g. 0.1 S/cm); if $Œª$ drops (dry membrane), $\sigma$ falls and ohmic losses rise steeply @springerPolymerElectrolyteFuel1991 .

The resistivity in the electrode catalyst layer as a function of the the material resistivity ($œÅ_{el}$) is  of the electrode(ohm.cm), ($t_{el}$) is the electrode thickness(cm) ($t_{el}$), is the catalyst layer resistance
$$
R_{\text{elec}} = \frac{t_{\text{el}}}{A_{\text{cell}} }\cdot \rho_{\text{el}}
\tag{20}
$$
$$
V_{\text{ohm,cat}} = V_{\text{ohm,an}} = \rho_{\text{el}} \cdot t_{\text{el}} \cdot i
\tag{21}
$$


A well distributed resistance along the flow-filed length and channels are given as (Fig 111) , the internal resistance of a PEM electrolyzer @hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 .
![[image-68.png]]


Each component resistance is determined as follows:

The total Plate resistance along flow-field length $L_{ab}$  is given as @hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 ,
$$ R_{bpp1} = \rho_{p}\,\dfrac{L_{ab}}{A} \tag{22}
$$
$$R_{bpp2} = \rho_{p}\,\dfrac{L_{bc}}{0.5\,L_{ik}\,L}\tag{23}$$

The resistance from to electrodes and gas channel, in-plane r and through-plane is given as, @hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015
$$R_{e1ec1} = \rho_{e}\,\dfrac{0.25\,L_{kl}}{t_{el}\,L\,(1 - \varepsilon)} \tag{24}$$
$$R_{elec2} = \rho_{e}\,\dfrac{t_{el}}{0.5\,L_{km}\,L\,(1 - \varepsilon)} \tag{25}$$
$$R_{elec3} = \rho_{el}\,\dfrac{t_{e}}{L_{kl}\,L\,(1 - \varepsilon)}\tag{26}$$

Where as the Interfacial resistance is empirically taken as twice the through-plane electrode resistance, $R_{\rm in}=2\,R_{e2}$, to fit polarization data. @marangioDirectHighPressure2009


### Mass Transport (Concentration) Losses
 At high current, reactant consumption can cause concentration gradients and depletion near the electrodes, leading to an additional overpotential .When the reactant supply rate cannot meet the demand, the local partial pressure (or concentration) at the catalyst drops, effectively lowering the cell voltage.  Assuming a limiting current density $i_L$ of 6 $A/cm^2$  (when reactant at the interface goes to zero), the loss can be written as [@bessarabovPEMWaterElectrolysis2018](Bessarabov & Millet, 2018)
 
$$
V_{\text{conc}} = \frac{RT}{nF} \ln\left(1 - \frac{i}{i_L}\right)
$$


### Overall Cell Voltage and Efficiencies 
Combining these contributions, the instantaneous total voltage under under steady-state conditions for a number of cell $N_{\text{cell}}$ is:
$$V_{\text{cell}} = V_{\text{rev}} + V_{\text{act, anode}} + V_{\text{act, cathode}} + V_{\text{ohm}} + V_{\text{conc}}$$
$$V_{\text{stack}} = N_{\text{cell}} V_{\text{cell}}$$

Faradaic Efficiency
We define a faraday efficiency  $\eta_F$ to account for current losses like hydrogen crossover or internal shunt current . Thus the fraction of the applied current that prouces the target reaction products. 

$$\eta_F = \frac{\text{actual reaction current}}{\text{total current}} = 1 - \frac{i_{\text{loss}}}{i} \tag{}$$

where $i_{\text{loss}}$ is the parasitic current density corresponding to side reactions or crossover.
A high-quality membrane (thicker or less permeable) and lower differential pressure improve $\eta_F$ by reducing crossover.
In practice, Faraday efficiency in modern PEM electrolyzers can exceed 98‚Äì99% at high current density, but drops at low loads or high pressure due to increased crossover @kangIntroducingNovelTechnique2021
 Faradaic losses manifest as a lower observed hydrogen production (or lower fuel cell current for a given fuel feed) and is modeled here as an efficiency loss rather than a direct voltage term.

## The mass and Energy  balance

The mass balance based on Faraday's law of electrolysis.
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">insp</mark>: @abdolrahimOverviewPolymerElectrolyte2016


![[image-67.png]]
The reactant water $\dot n^{a}_{H_2O,\text{in}}$ is fed to the anode half-cell and is consumed to form oxygen and protons. The oxygen and water are recirculated from the anode half cell to through the gas separator.
$$
\dot n^{a}_{O_2,\text{out}} = \dot n^{a}_{O_2,\text{in}} + \frac{i A_{\text{cell}}}{4F}
$$
$$
\dot n^{a}_{H_2O,\text{out}} = \dot n^{a}_{H_2O,\text{in}} + \frac{i A_{\text{cell}}}{2F} + \dot n^{\text{trans}}_{H_2O}
$$
Water  crossover through the membrane via multiple mechanisms: electro-osmotic drag $\dot n_{\text{osm}}$ , back-diffusion $\dot n_{\text{diff}}$, and hydraulic permeation $\dot n_{\text{hyd}}$, though electro-osmotic drag is the dominant mechanism.
$$\dot n^{\text{trans}}_{H_2O}=\dot n_{\text{osm}}+\dot n_{\text{diff}}+\dot n_{\text{hyd}}$$

$$
\dot n^{\text{trans}}_{H_2O}  = n_d \cdot \frac{i}{F}
$$
The electroosmotic drag coefficient $n_d$   quantifies the amount of water molecules transported through a membrane per proton.  Water molecules are carried along with protons across the membrane from anode to cathode by electro-osmotic drag ( $\dot n_{\text{osm}}$ (mol/m¬≤¬∑s)). 
$$n_d(T) = 0.0134 \, T + 0.03 \quad (T \text{ in } ^\circ\text{C}) \quad$$ @ondaPerformanceAnalysisPolymerElectrolyte2002 

$$\dot n_{\text{osm}} = \frac{n_d\, i}{F}\ , \tag{10}
$$
When the cathode side get very moist with concentration difference, water tends to diffuse across the membrane .  $\dot n_{\text{diff}}$ represents the molar flow due to the concentration gradient between the half cells. A diffusive water flux can be written analogously to Fick‚Äôs law:
$$\dot n_{\text{diff}} = -D_w\,\frac{dC_w}{dx} \tag{11}$$
(where $C_w$ is water concentration in the membrane). it‚Äôs written in terms of water content $Œª$ (number of water molecules per sulfonic acid group) @leeThreeDimensionalTransportModeling2008 .
$$\dot n_{\text{diff}} = -\,\frac{D_\lambda \,\rho_{\text{dry}}}{EW}\,\frac{dŒª}{dx} , \tag{12}$$
with $\rho_{\text{dry}}$ the dry membrane density and $EW$ the equivalent weight (kg/mol of sulfonic acid) ( 
This form converts $‚àáŒª$ to a concentration gradient ($\rho_{\text{dry}}/EW$ is mol sulfonic sites per volume). $D_w$ (or $D_Œª$) strongly depends on hydration; empirical fits are used @leeThreeDimensionalTransportModeling2008.

Hydraulic crossover occurs due to the pressure difference across the membrane. This is modeled by Darcy‚Äôs law for flow through a porous medium: @itoPropertiesNafionMembranes2011
$$\dot n_{\text{hyd}} = -\frac{K_{\text{mem}}}{\mu_w}\,\Delta p \tag{13}$$
Where $K_{\text{mem}}$ is the effective permeability of the membrane to water, and $\mu_w$ water viscosity. Darcy-driven water flux is generally small in PEM fuel cells, but in water electrolyzers with thin membranes at high differential pressure, it can contribute to additional hydrogen crossover.

Hydrogen and oxygen leaves the cathode half cell and are future processed and recirculated in the $H_2$ gas separator.
$$
\dot n^{c}_{H_2,\text{out}} =\dot n^{c}_{H_2,\text{in}} + \frac{i A_{\text{cell}}}{2F}
$$
$$
\dot n^{c}_{H_2O,\text{out}} =\dot n^{c}_{H_2O,\text{in}} - \frac{i A_{\text{cell}}}{F} - n^{\text{trans}}_{H_2O}
$$

The energy balance of cell
A PEM cell generates heat from multiple sources: (i) the reaction enthalpy that is not converted to electrical work, and (ii) Joule heating from ohmic losses, and (iii) any heat of mixing or phase change (e.g. water evaporation/condensation). The overall reaction ( $H_2 + ¬ΩO_2 ‚Üí H_2O$ ) is exothermic with reaction enthalpy ŒîH ‚âà ‚Äì286 kJ/mol (liquid water) at 25 ¬∞C . The 49 kJ/mol difference in ŒîH and ŒîG is released as heat even at open circuit .
Additional overpotential losses further converts electrical energy to heat. Therefore, the heat generation rate (W) in a single cell can be expressed as:
 $$Q_{\text{gen}} = I \big( \Delta H/2F - V_{\text{cell}} \big) + I^2 R_{\text{eq}}, \tag{}$$
where $I(\Delta H/2F)$ is the total chemical energy input per second (for reaction at current $I$), $I V_{\text{cell}}$ is the electric power output, and the difference is the reaction heat. The $I^2R$ term adds Joule heating.

The temperature of the cell is determined by an energy balance that includes heat generation, heat removal, and energy flow from the reactant and product streams. We assume the cell has a uniform temperature. For a lumped cell mass $m$ with heat capacity $C_p$
$$m C_p \frac{dT}{dt} = Q_{\text{gen}} - Q_{\text{cool}} - Q_{\text{env}}, \tag{}$$
where $Q_{\text{cool}}$ is heat removed by coolant and $Q_{\text{env}}$ is losses to ambient (convection, radiation). We assume steady-state is reached when generation equals removal. The bipolar plates are used to dissipate heat and maintain uniform temperature. Non-uniform temperature can cause dry spots or flooding in different areas, so thermal management aims to keep the cell at an optimal temperature (often ~60‚Äì80¬†¬∞C) @molinaHeatManagementSystem2024 .

(if liquid cooled or by conduction to heat sink)


$$
H_{a,\text{in}} + H_{c,\text{in}} + W_{\text{cell}} = H_{a,\text{out}} + H_{c,\text{out}}
$$
$$
W_{\text{cell}} = i \, V_{\text{cell}} \, A_{\text{cell}}
$$

### 3.3 Energy System Modeling

#### 3.3.1 Photovoltaic (PV) Power Model

In modeling the photovoltaic (PV) system, the goal is to accurately estimate electricity generation from solar energy to incorporate into broader energy system to hydrogen analyses. The output power of the PV is dependent on the solar irradiation intensity that falls on the surface of the PV array and the module‚Äôs temperature. The hourly and yearly PV power output can be represented as @khattakTechnoeconomicEnvironmentalAnalysis2024

$$
P_{PV,hY} = P_{STC,rated} f_{derPV,y} \frac{GTI_h}{G_{STC}} \left( 1 + \alpha_p \left( T_{PV}^{h} - T_{STC} \right) \right) P_{losses}
$$
$P_{STC,rated}$ represents the rated peak capacity of the PV system under standard test conditions (STC)  at 1 MW rating. To account for module efficiency reduction over time, the annual derating factor $f_{derPV,y}$ is applied. The global tilted irradiance (${GTI_h}$), measured in kW/m¬≤, describes the solar radiation intensity incident on the tilted photovoltaic module surfaces during hour $h$ . Solar irradiance data commonly available online are given as global horizontal irradiance (GHI). Therefore, to obtain the global tilted irradiance (GTI), this data  is adjusted based on the tilt and orientation of the solar panels.  This conversion involves correcting for the module's tilt angle and solar geometry, applying the following equation: @uchennaWindsolarHybridPower2012


$$
GTI = GHI \frac{\sin(\sigma + \theta)}{\sin \sigma}
$$
Here, $Œ∏_{PV}$  is the angle at which the photovoltaic panels are tilted relative to the horizontal.  œÉ represents the angle of solar elevation, defined as: @elmghouchiModelsObtainingDaily2016


$$
\sigma = 90 - \phi + \delta
$$

$\phi$ represents the latitude of the installation site, while $\delta$  stands for the solar declination angle, which varies throughout the year and is defined as @elmghouchiModelsObtainingDaily2016

$$
\delta = 23.4 \cos \left( \frac{360}{365} (d + 284) \right)
$$

with corresponding to the day number of the year from1 through 365.
The cell temperature ($T_{\rm cell}[h]$) influences efficiency and energy output, adjusted against the standard temperature conditions ($T_{\rm STC}=25 ¬∞C$ ) through the temperature coefficient $\alpha_p\approx -0.0035/¬∞\text{C}$. @duboisStepbystepEvaluationPhotovoltaic2017
$$T_{\rm cell}[h] = T_{\rm amb}[h] + \frac{\mathrm{NOCT} - 20}{800} \;G[h]$$
with $T_{\rm amb}[h]$ from a seasonal sine noise to reflect seasonal variations and Nominal Operating cell Temp C  ( NOCT) . Systematic losses such as inverter efficiency, cable losses, and thermal effects are accounted for as $f_{\rm derate}\approx0.90$ . Inclusion of these losses enhances the accuracy and applicability of the PV model, ensuring comprehensive evaluation and reliability when incorporated into broader energy system simulations and analyses.




### 3.3.2 Wind Power Plant Modeling

The surrogate modeling of wind energy generation involves calculating the wind turbine's power output as a function of wind speed, considering several performance-related factors. The relationship used to determine the wind turbine power output ($P_{WT}$ ) at any given moment governed by the Betz-Lanchester equation as: @duffieSolarEngineeringThermal2020

$$
P_{WT} = 0.5 \eta_{WT} \rho A C_p(\lambda, \beta) v^3
$$
The mechanical efficiency,($\eta_{WT}$ ), accounts for energy losses in critical mechanical components such as gearboxes and drivetrains, directly influencing the effective power available from wind energy conversion. The air density ($\rho$) (typically approximated at 1.23 kg/m¬≥), is essential as denser air carries more kinetic energy, significantly affecting power output. @gunturuCharacterizationWindPower2012 The swept area ($A$),m¬≤ is defined by the circular area created by rotating turbine blades, determines the quantity of wind intercepted, thus proportionally affecting turbine output.

The power coefficient, ($C_p(\lambda, \beta$)), captures the aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine and varies according to the tip speed ratio ($\lambda$) and blade pitch angle (($\beta$)).  (($\lambda$))  is the ratio of blade tip speed to wind speed while ($\beta$), which adjusts the blades‚Äô orientation relative to wind flow to optimize efficiency. The polynomial power coefficient curves from literature are reported in<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> table3.3.2</mark>  @castilloComparisonPowerCoefficients2023
$$
C_p(\lambda, \beta) = c_0 \left(\frac{c_1}{\lambda_i} - c_2\beta - c_3\beta\lambda_i - c_4\lambda_i^{c_5} - c_6 \right) e^{-\frac{c_7}{\lambda_i}} + c_8\lambda
$$

where:

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda_i} = \frac{1}{\lambda + c_9\beta + c_{10}} - \frac{c_{11}}{1 + \beta^3}
$$
Lastly, wind speed ($v$)), (m/s), critically influences power output as the cubic term indicates that even slight variations in wind speed significantly affect available power. 
The frequency of wind speeds $v$ is well-fitted by a Weibull probability density:

$f(v) \;=\; \frac{k}{\lambda} \Bigl(\frac{v}{\lambda}\Bigr)^{\,k - 1} \exp\!\Bigl[-\bigl(v/\lambda\bigr)^k\Bigr], \quad v \ge 0,$
where $\lambda$ is the scale parameter ( the average wind speed), and $k$ is the shape parameter ( peaked the distribution is). @zhangJointProbabilityDistribution2015 Seasonal and diurnal modulating factors are applied to the local velocity of wind. @jafarianEffectsEnviromentalParameters2008 The velocity is further adjusted to the height of the Turbine from ground level. @delgadoEvaluationVariabilityWind2016 
We clamped the design to cut-in/cut-out constrains for a 1 MW-based turbine to  protecting the turbine from structural stress such that.
     If $v < v_{\rm cut\text{-}in}$, output = 0.
     If $v_{\rm cut\text{-}in} \le v \le v_{\rm rated}$, output = $P_{\rm rated}\times\bigl(P_{\rm phys}(v)/P_{\rm phys}(v_{\rm rated})\bigr)$.
     If $v_{\rm rated} \le v \le v_{\rm cut\text{-}out}$, output = $P_{\rm rated}$.
    If $v > v_{\rm cut\text{-}out}$, output = 0.


$$
P_{wt} =
\begin{cases} 
    0, & v < v_c, \ v > v_s \\
    P_{wt}(v), & v_c \leq v \leq v_r \\
    P_{WT,rated}, & v_r \leq v \leq v_s
\end{cases}
$$
 No output is generated when wind speeds are below the cut-in speed or above the cut-out speed. Between the rated speed ($V_{r}$) and the cut-out speed ($V_{s}$), the turbine operates at a constant rated power ($P_{r}$).  For wind speeds between cut-in ( $V_{c}$ ) and rated speed ($V_{r}$), the output power follows the design  above, assuming that $A$, $\rho$ , and $C_{p}$ remain effectively constant. This modeling approach allows for accurate forecasting and effective integration of wind power within the broader energy system analysis.



### 3.3.3 Integration of Renewable Energy Plant Outputs

The total power output of the renewable energy (RE) plant, comprising both photovoltaic and wind energy systems, must be quantified to assess the overall energy balance at each hour (*h*) of the year (*y*). The total RE power output ( $P_{RE,h,y}$) is thus calculated as:

$$P_{RE,h,y} = P_{PV,h,y} + P_{WT,h,y}$$

To ensure continuous operation of the electrolyzer, which requires stable power input within the operational constraints of 5% to 100% of its rated capacity ( $P_{EL,rated}$ ), supplementary power from the upstream electrical grid may be required @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . Hence, the imported power ( $P_{import,h,y}$ ) from the grid is computed based on the minimal operational limit of the electrolyzer as follows:

$$ P_{import,h,y} = (0.05 \times P_{EL,rated}) - P_{RE,h,y}$$

This equation demonstrates that when the renewable energy production falls below the electrolyzer's minimum operational threshold, the deficit is compensated by importing power from the grid.

Conversely, when renewable energy production surpasses the electrolyzer‚Äôs maximum operational capacity (rated power  $P_{EL,rated}$) the excess electricity is directed back to the electrical grid. The exported power ( $P_{export,h,y}$ ) in such scenarios is calculated by:

$$P_{export,h,y} = P_{RE,h,y} - P_{EL,rated}$$

This comprehensive methodology enables thorough assessments of system performance, stability, and economic viability under varying operational conditions and renewable energy availability.
