## Draft 1

Agentic Machine Learning for Integrated Techno-Economic and Life-Cycle Systems Analysis

## Abstract

Process systems analysis (PSA) underpins technology assessment, investment decisions, and policy design, yet it is slow, expert-intensive, and difficult to reproduce. This PhD proposes an **agentic, LLM-enabled co-pilot** that orchestrates open-source PSA tools through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and Python toolchains to deliver **techno-economic analysis (TEA)** and **life-cycle assessment (LCA)** with rigorous uncertainty, interpretability, and human-in-the-loop governance.
Case studies in hydrogen (PEM), biorefineries, and plastics recycling demonstrate: (i) reliable cost/impact estimates with quantified uncertainty; (ii) design space exploration for cost–carbon–water trade-offs; and (iii) an auditable conversational interface that shortens expert workflows and improves reproducibility.
Deliverables include open protocols for TEA–LCA coupling, benchmark datasets, an MCP tool suite, and validated ML models for robust decision support.

## 1) Motivation & Research Gap

- **Fragmented workflows:** TEA and LCA are often performed in separate tools with manual data handoffs, leading to mismatches in system boundaries, functional units, and cut-off rules.
- **Slow iteration:** Rigorous flowsheet simulation and LCI compilation are compute- and labor-intensive; sensitivity and Monte Carlo propagate this cost.
- **Limited accessibility:** Expert knowledge (allocation, background database choices, coproduct handling) is tacit; documentation and provenance are inconsistent.
- **Emerging opportunity:** **Agentic LLMs** can plan tasks, enforce schemas, call tools, and keep audit trails; **MCP** standardizes tool calling; **surrogates** and **active learning** can replace many expensive simulations while preserving fidelity and uncertainty.
## 2) Objectives & Hypotheses

**O1.** Build an **agentic co-pilot** that plans, executes, and explains PSA tasks across TEA and LCA tools using MCP.
**O2.** Develop **physics-aware predictive models** (e.g., GPs, PINNs, and gradient-boosted trees) as surrogates for flowsheet/calculator evaluations with calibrated uncertainty.
**O3.** Create a **robust TEA–LCA coupling layer** that harmonizes system boundaries, functional units, and allocation while retaining provenance for auditability.
**O4.** Demonstrate **uncertainty-aware, multi-objective optimization** of cost, GHG, water, and energy; quantify robustness under data and model uncertainty.
**O5.** Evaluate usability and reproducibility: measure time-to-result, error rates, and decision quality with and without the co-pilot.

**H1.** An MCP-orchestrated agent can **reduce expert time** to complete end-to-end TEA+LCA by ≥50% while maintaining methodological correctness.  
**H2.** Surrogates trained via active learning can achieve **≤5–10% error** on key metrics (e.g., MSP, GWP100) at **10–100× speedup**.  
**H3.** Provenance-first, schema-enforced workflows increase **reproducibility** and reduce methodological inconsistencies across studies.



## 5) Case Studies

1. **PEM Hydrogen Production**
    - Design variables: current density, pressure, temperature, membrane thickness, stack sizing, BoP configurations, electricity mixes.
    - Outputs: LCOH/MSP; GWP100; sensitivity to grid CI, stack life, membrane cost; **robust design** under market volatility.
        
2. **Lignocellulosic Biorefinery (BioSTEAM)**
    - Feedstock blends, enzyme loadings, distillation/fermentation choices; coproduct crediting vs allocation.
    - TEA–LCA coupling to compare product slates (ethanol, SAF blendstocks, biochemicals).
        
3. **Plastics Recycling & Waste-to-Energy Interactions**
    - MRF configurations, mechanical vs chemical recycling, WTE synergies; EPR and recycled content scenarios.
    - Policy scenarios: carbon price, EPR fees; **marginal abatement cost** curves.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Current Challenges in Process Systems Analysis

Process systems analysis, encompassing technoeconomic analysis and life cycle assessment, represents a critical bottleneck in sustainable process development. Current methodologies suffer from several limitations:

- **Expertise Barriers**: TEA and LCA require specialized domain knowledge, limiting accessibility to non-experts
- **Time Intensity**: Manual analysis processes can take weeks to months for comprehensive assessments
- **Inconsistency**: Human analysts introduce variability in methodological choices and interpretation
- **Integration Complexity**: Coupling TEA and LCA requires navigating disparate software ecosystems and data formats
- **Limited Predictive Capability**: Traditional approaches are reactive rather than predictive, limiting proactive optimization

### 1.2 Emerging Opportunities

Recent advances in machine learning, particularly large language models and agentic AI systems, present unprecedented opportunities to address these challenges. The convergence of several technological trends creates a unique research opportunity:

- **LLM Reasoning Capabilities**: Modern LLMs demonstrate sophisticated reasoning about technical domains
- **Tool Integration Protocols**: MCP enables seamless integration of specialized analytical tools
- **Mature Python Ecosystem**: Libraries like Biosteam and Brightway provide robust computational foundations
- **Agentic AI Frameworks**: Autonomous agents can orchestrate complex analytical workflows


## 2. Literature Review and Research Gap

### 2.1 Current State of Process Systems Analysis

Traditional process systems analysis relies heavily on specialized software tools and expert knowledge. Biosteam has emerged as a leading platform for biorefinery TEA, offering comprehensive process modeling capabilities. Similarly, Brightway provides sophisticated LCA computational frameworks with extensive database integration capabilities. However, these tools require significant expertise and manual configuration.

Recent work in automated process analysis has focused primarily on optimization algorithms and sensitivity analysis. Limited research has explored the integration of natural language interfaces with specialized analytical tools for autonomous systems analysis.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Process Engineering

Machine learning applications in process engineering have primarily focused on process control, optimization, and predictive maintenance. Emerging research explores LLM applications in chemical engineering, but comprehensive frameworks for autonomous systems analysis remain unexplored.

### 2.3 Research Gap

The literature reveals a significant gap in intelligent, autonomous frameworks capable of conducting end-to-end process systems analysis. No existing work combines LLM reasoning capabilities with specialized TEA/LCA tools through standardized protocols like MCP to create truly autonomous analytical copilots.
