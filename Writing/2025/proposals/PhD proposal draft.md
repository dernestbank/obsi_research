## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

Process Systems Analysis (PSA) is critical in chemical engineering for evaluating the viability and sustainability of process designs through techniques like techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA).  TEA quantifies capital and operating costs, economics, and techno-feasibility, while LCA quantifies environmental impacts across a product’s life cycle
Despite their importance, current PSA practices face significant challenges. Performing a rigorous LCA demands “a great deal of time and data”, which often limits its application during early process development. @kockAutomationLifeCycle2023 TEA and LCA are typically carried out by different domain experts using separate tools (e.g. process simulators for TEA, LCA software for environmental analysis), leading to expertise bottlenecks and integration complexity.
