## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

Process Systems Analysis (PSA) is critical in chemical engineering for evaluating the viability and sustainability of process designs through techniques like techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA).  TEA quantifies capital and operating costs, economics, and techno-feasibility, while LCA quantifies environmental impacts across a productâ€™s life cycle
