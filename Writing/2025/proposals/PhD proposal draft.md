 Agentic Machine-Learning Framework for Autonomous Process Systems Analysis Integrating Techno-Economic Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment


key words: low TRL,

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement
Process systems analysis (PSA) plays a critical role in evaluating the viability and sustainability of chemical processes through **techno-economic analysis (TEA)** and **life cycle assessment (LCA)**. TEA assesses the economic performance (e.g. costs, profitability) of a process or product, while LCA quantifies environmental impacts across the process life cycle. TEA and LCA provide complementary insights for decision-makers but require extensive data collection and computation, which is often a limiting factor especially for emerging technologies.
Most studies frequently rely on ad-hoc spreadsheet models, specialized tools and human expertise, making it difficult to rapidly iterate designs or integrate new data. 
Current PSA methods face limitations in terms of integration, efficiency, and scope. @kockAutomationLifeCycle2023 Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) – notably **large language models (LLMs)** – present an opportunity to **automate and accelerate PSA** beyond the conventional paradigm.
This proposal outlines a research plan to develop a novel LLM-driven agentic framework that orchestrates process simulation tools, TEA/LCA models, and predictive ML in a unified system. The goal is to **streamline and enhance TEA-LCA workflows** using AI agents, enabling faster, more comprehensive process evaluations. 


The proposed research will 
(1) characterize the limitations of current TEA-LCA methods from literature, 
(2) identify gaps in integrating TEA, LCA, LLMs, and ML, 
(3) design an improved system architecture (with AI agent logic, tool orchestration, and data flows), 
(4) implement predictive models (Gaussian processes, PINNs, gradient boosting) alongside process simulators (e.g. Aspen Plus or BioSTEAM), LCA software (Brightway2/OpenLCA), and optimization techniques (Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning), 
(5) validate the framework on multiple case studies (such as hydrogen production, biorefineries, plastics recycling) with coupled TEA-LCA metrics, 
(6) establish a timeline with milestones (including a Gantt chart), 
(7) compare our approach with existing PSA automation efforts, 
(8) highlight key contributions, and 
(9) address ethical and reproducibility considerations. 
By leveraging only peer-reviewed sources from high-impact journals throughout, we ensure the approach is grounded in state-of-the-art knowledge. 


## Limitations of Current PSA Methods in TEA and LCA

Conventional TEA and LCA are often performed in _siloed workflows_, using different tools and assumptions, which makes integrated analysis challenging. The  economic perspective and the lif-cycle perpective often habour different system boundaries and functional units. Literature reviews show that differing system boundaries and perspective biases can lead to _conflicting conclusions_, unless carefully harmonized[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Goal%20and%20scope%20,However%2C%20the%20selection%20of)[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20The%20inventory%20,can%20have%20monetary%20impacts%2C%20such). **Norris (2001)** highlighted the need to integrate economic implications into LCA and vice versa, yet also noted difficulties in interpreting combined results[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=remaining%20gaps%20in%20literature%20Norris,TCA%20aims%20at%20including%20often)[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=life%20cycle%20assessment%20results%2C%20companies,environmental%20results%20is%20not%20presented). This **lack of integration** can cause inconsistencies – e.g. using a different benchmark or feedstock in TEA vs. LCA yields incomparable outcomes[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=benchmarks%20for%20comparison%20within%20each,benchmarks%20need%20to%20be%20identical). Azapagic et al. (2006) found that if economic and environmental benchmarks differ (cheapest vs. greenest alternative), the integrated assessment can send mixed signals[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=benchmarks%20for%20comparison%20within%20each,of%20the%20technology%2C%20the%20benchmarks). 

One challenge with integrated systems analysis is the methodological differences. TEA output units (e.g. USD) cannot be directly aggregated with LCA outputs (e.g. kg CO₂) without subjective weighting or conversion (as in single-score sustainability metrics)[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20The%20impact%20calculation%20,impacts%20are%20often%20considered%20static). This makes interpreting integrated TEA-LCA results difficult – studies have noted that combining economic and environmental indicators requires careful normalization or multi-criteria analysis, often lacking standard guidelines[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=dimensions,required%20information%20from%20additional%20assessments). **Wunderlich et al. (2021)** reviewed 70 papers and found an _“increasing number of contributions”_ on TEA-LCA integration, but _no commonly followed definition_ or framework for doing so[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=dimensions,required%20information%20from%20additional%20assessments). The authors identified a **knowledge gap** in how to practically integrate TEA and LCA from the ground up, as most studies used case-specific or qualitative integration methods[eprints.whiterose.ac.uk](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/208376/1/Wunderlich_etal_Integration_2021.pdf#:~:text=dimensions,required%20information%20from%20additional%20assessments). This gap leaves practitioners without clear methodological guidance. 
Another challenge is **uncertainty propagation**. Early-stage process data are often sparse and uncertain, which cascades through both TEA and LCA. _Zimmermann et al. (2022)_ point out that at low technology readiness levels, many data are missing or not representative of future scales[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.841907/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L694%20A%20central,not%20yet%20measured%20or%20modeled)[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.841907/full#:~:text=A%20central%20challenge%20when%20assessing,not%20yet%20measured%20or%20modeled). This leads to high uncertainty in both cost and impact estimates. Conventional approaches handle this via scenario analysis or sensitivity analysis, which are labor-intensive to do comprehensively

Today’s PSA practice is **labor-intensive, slow, and non-autonomous** – hindering our ability to quickly evaluate new ideas or identify optimal designs under both economic and environmental criteria. Conducting an LCA involves four phases (goal/scope, inventory analysis, impact assessment, interpretation) per ISO 14040/44, and the _inventory phase (LCI) is extremely time- and resource-intensive_[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=processes%20that%20are%20still%20in,and%20can%20improve%20data%20quality)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=and%20can%20improve%20data%20quality). Collecting input/output data for potentially **thousands of unit processes** is painstaking[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=,9)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=be%20collected%20for%20the%20parameters,129). Köck et al. (2023) note that even for a single LCA, “_thousands of unit processes are usually used_” requiring large volumes of data from lab experiments, databases, and literature[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=As%20the%20most%20time,and%20uncertainty%20distribution%20should%20also)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=,9). This complexity often _deters iterative use_ of LCA during process design; instead, LCA is done after a process design is fixed[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20chemical%20process%20simulations,integration%20of%20LCA%20in%20process). Similarly, TEA is frequently done via custom spreadsheets or process simulator economic reports, which must be updated by hand when the design changes. **Integrating LCA with process simulation is possible** (e.g. via add-ons or exporting data), but typically not automated. A review of LCA automation efforts found that while some tools link LCA software with process simulators, they often require _ad hoc scripting or even GUI trickery_ (e.g. a “Java robot mouse emulator” to transfer data between programs)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=This%20builds%20an%20automated%20connection,emulator%2C%20which%20simulated%20manual%20user)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=framework%20integrates%20LCA%20and%20process,when%20integrated%20with%20the%20process). For example, Mutel et al. connected gPROMS process simulator to Umberto LCA software by using Excel as an intermediary and simulating user input because no direct API was available[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/5531#:~:text=This%20builds%20an%20automated%20connection,emulator%2C%20which%20simulated%20manual%20user). These kinds of solutions underscore the lack of seamless integration – current workflows resemble a patchwork of _“glue” code and manual steps_ prone to error. One study described that to optimize a design considering LCA and TEA, _designers had to go back-and-forth iteratively_, manually adjusting the process and re-running analyses until some compromise was found. This trial-and-error approach is **computationally and cognitively challenging**, and may miss optimal solutions.

The following gaps highlight where innovation is needed to overcome these limitations.






Recent reviews highlight a pressing need for automation and integration in PSA. Köck _et al._ (2023) found that automating data flow between process simulations and LCA can “make integration of environmental impacts into decisions easier, less time-consuming, and improve data quality”.  However, existing efforts at PSA automation remain limited. Automation has been implemented mostly via custom interfaces linking simulators to LCA databases, or via machine learning (e.g. neural networks for predicting molecular properties). Fewer than one-third of published methods share open code, and only 10 of 30 surveyed papers included uncertainty analysis @kockAutomationLifeCycle2023 – indicating that current solutions are often proprietary, not reproducible, and may neglect uncertainty quantification.

Research Gap

No existing framework unifies TEA, LCA, large language models (LLMs), and predictive machine learning in an _autonomous, agentic system_ for process analysis. Tools like **BioSTEAM** (an open-source process simulation and TEA platform) and its LCA extension have demonstrated the value of tighter integration – e.g. BioSTEAM-LCA automates early-stage TEA-LCA for biorefineries, enabling simultaneous economic and environmental evaluation under uncertainty.
 BioSTEAM integrates uncertainty into simulations to _“streamline and automate early-stage technology evaluations”_, providing rigorous sensitivity analyses. It _“enables the integration of design, simulation, TEA and LCA to improve consistency and transparency”_ of sustainability metrics
@cortes-penaBioSTEAMBiorefinerySimulation2020; @cortes-penaBioSTEAMFastFlexible2020 . Yet, even these advanced tools do not incorporate the **agentic intelligence** now possible with AI. Large Language Models have recently shown remarkable ability to plan and execute complex tasks autonomously in scientific workflows



**2. Background and Related Work**

Machine learning has been applied to expedite process simulations and optimize designs. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is widely used to create surrogate models of expensive simulation outputs, providing fast predictions with uncertainty estimates – a cornerstone of Bayesian optimization. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a way to embed physical laws into neural network models, enabling surrogates that respect conservation laws or known kinetics, thus improving extrapolative reliability. Gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and other ensemble methods are also popular for their efficiency in approximating complex relationships with modest data. In process engineering, such surrogates have proven valuable. For example, GP and neural network surrogates have been used to approximate flowsheet performance, allowing rapid evaluation in optimization algorithms (e.g. in biorefinery superstructure optimizations[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338930278_BioSTEAM_A_Fast_and_Flexible_Platform_for_the_Design_Simulation_and_Techno-Economic_Analysis_of_Biorefineries_Under_Uncertainty#:~:text=,refinery%20structure.)).
Despite these benefits, integrating surrogate modeling into a general PSA workflow is non-trivial. 

The advent of large language models has unlocked new paradigms for automation. LLM-based agents can interpret high-level instructions, generate plans, call software tools, and self-correct based on feedback.
In chemical engineering and related fields, this concept is only beginning to be explored.
Vyas & Mercangoz (2025) introduced an _“agentic framework for industrial automation”_ using LLMs for both discrete planning and continuous control
Another study by Zhihan Liu _et al._ (2024) developed an Autonomous Simulation Agent (ASA) that _“automates the entire simulation research process”_ using LLM prompt engineering[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512#:~:text=,4o). Given a research goal, their ASA designs experiments, runs simulations on remote servers, analyzes data, and compiles reports – iterating up to 20 cycles without human intervention[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512#:~:text=experimental%20processes%20and%20computational%20simulations,flawless)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512#:~:text=execution%20on%20designated%20research%20missions%2C,local%20attention%20and%20global%20oversight). It achieved near-flawless execution on a polymer simulation case, showcasing reliability of LLM agents in long-horizon tasks[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512#:~:text=of%20polymer%20chain%20conformations%20as,validation%20mechanisms%2C%20and).

Beyond static optimization, reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for process synthesis and decision-making. Gao _et al._ (2023) showed that RL algorithms can _“learn to build process flowsheets”_ by sequentially adding unit operations and connections, in tandem with a process simulator (DWSIM) providing rewards[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03375#:~:text=,are%20employed%20to%20accelerate%20the)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03375#:~:text=learn%20to%20build%20process%20flowsheets,that%20stores%20knowledge%20gained%20while). 
A challenge noted is the heavy computational demand: an RL agent may require thousands of simulator calls, so researchers often resort to simplified “shortcut” models to train the agent, sacrificing accuracy[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03375#:~:text=learn%20to%20build%20process%20flowsheets,that%20stores%20knowledge%20gained%20while). Gao _et al._ addressed this via transfer learning, pre-training the RL agent on easier models and then fine-tuning on the rigorous simulator, which yielded an economically feasible flowsheet with 8% higher revenue while halving learning time[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03375#:~:text=RL%20agent%20demands%20numerous%20process,process%20design%20and%20apply%20it)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03375#:~:text=separation%2C%20and%20recycles%2C%20our%20method,can%20be%20reduced%20by%20a).
