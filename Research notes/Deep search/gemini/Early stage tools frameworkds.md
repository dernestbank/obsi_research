Hydrogen is gaining increased attention as a clean energy carrier with the potential to decarbonize various sectors, including transportation, industry, and power generation. As the world transitions towards a hydrogen economy, accurate cost analysis of hydrogen production pathways becomes crucial for decision-making, investment strategies, and policy development. This article provides a comprehensive review of early-stage cost analysis tools and frameworks for hydrogen production, focusing on their methodologies, strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for research purposes.

## Cost Components of Hydrogen Production

Before delving into the specific tools and frameworks, it's essential to understand the key cost components associated with hydrogen production. These components are crucial inputs for any cost analysis methodology and can significantly influence the economic viability of a hydrogen production pathway. The primary cost components include:

- Capital Costs: These costs encompass the initial investment required for building and commissioning hydrogen production plants. This includes expenses related to land acquisition, equipment purchase and installation, construction of facilities, and engineering design1. The scale of the production facility, the chosen production technology, and the level of automation can all influence capital costs.
    
- Operating Costs: These costs cover the expenses associated with the day-to-day operation of the hydrogen production facility. This includes labor costs, utilities such as electricity and water, maintenance and repair expenses, and costs associated with feedstock handling and storage1. Operating costs can vary significantly depending on the production technology, the efficiency of the process, and the local cost of resources.
    
- Feedstock Costs: The cost of raw materials used in hydrogen production is a major factor in the overall cost analysis1. Different hydrogen production pathways utilize different feedstocks, such as natural gas for steam methane reforming (SMR), biomass for gasification, or water for electrolysis. The availability and cost of these feedstocks can vary significantly depending on geographical location and market conditions.
    
- Efficiency and Yield: The efficiency of the hydrogen production process and the yield of hydrogen obtained from the feedstock are critical factors in determining the final cost of hydrogen1. Higher efficiency processes require less energy and resources to produce the same amount of hydrogen, leading to lower operating costs. Similarly, a higher yield ensures that more hydrogen is extracted from the feedstock, maximizing resource utilization and reducing overall costs.
    
- Revenues: Potential revenue streams from the sale of hydrogen and any byproducts are also considered in the economic assessment1. The price of hydrogen can vary depending on market demand, purity requirements, and delivery methods. Additionally, some hydrogen production processes generate valuable byproducts, such as oxygen from electrolysis or carbon dioxide from SMR with carbon capture and storage (CCS).
