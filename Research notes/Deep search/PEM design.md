I will develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the PEM electrochemical module, incorporating both numerical and analytical equations, covering steady-state and transient models. The model will include the effects of overpotentials at the anode and cathode, the Nernst equation, Butler-Volmer equation, mass transport equations for hydrogen, oxygen, and water, as well as water crossover and Faraday's efficiency. Additionally, it will integrate geometric parameters, electrode parameters, and membrane properties, along with thermal effects and water management.

I will gather information from peer-reviewed journals, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to ensure an in-depth and accurate formulation of the model. I will notify you once the research is complete.

# 1. Electrochemical Equations

**Open-Circuit Voltage (Nernst Equation):** A PEM electrochemical cell’s reversible open-circuit voltage is given by the Nernst equation, which accounts for the reaction free energy and reactant/product activities. For the hydrogen–oxygen reaction (H2 + ½O2 → H2O), the equilibrium potential _E_ depends on temperature _T_ and species activities (often approximated by partial pressures). At standard conditions (1 atm, 298 K) with liquid water product, _E_ ≈ 1.229 V ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%88%86G%20nF%20%3D%201,in%20changing%20the%20output%20potential)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=Nernst%E2%80%99s%20equation%20shows%20these%20correlations%3A,ln%20A%20aH2%20%E2%88%9AaO2%20aH2O)). More generally, one can write:

$$E_{\text{rev}} \;=\; E^0 + \frac{RT}{2F}\ln\!\Bigg(\frac{a_{\text{H}_2}\,\sqrt{a_{\text{O}_2}}}{\,a_{\text{H}_2O}\,}\Bigg) \tag{1}$$

where $E^0$ is the standard potential (≈1.23 V for the PEM reaction), $R$ is the gas constant, $F$ Faraday’s constant, and $a_{i}$ are activities of H2, O2, and H2O ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=Nernst%E2%80%99s%20equation%20shows%20these%20correlations%3A,ln%20A%20aH2%20%E2%88%9AaO2%20aH2O)). For gases, $a_{gas}\approx p_{gas}/p^0$ (ratio of partial to standard pressure) and for liquid water $a_{\text{H}_2O}\approx1$ (if product is liquid water) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=of%20each%20component,For)). Equation (1) shows that increasing hydrogen or oxygen pressure raises the open-circuit voltage, while accumulating product water (e.g. vapor) lowers it. Temperature dependence enters through $E^0(T)$; a more detailed form includes entropy change $\Delta S$ (since $E_{\text{rev}} = \Delta G/(nF)$ and $\Delta G=\Delta H - T\Delta S$). For small deviations around 298 K one can approximate $E_{\text{rev}}(T)=E^0 + \frac{\Delta S}{2F}(T-298~\text{K}) - \frac{RT}{2F}\ln(...)$ ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=The%20Nernst%20equation%20is%20used,%E2%88%92%20%F0%9D%91%85%F0%9D%91%87)), capturing the thermodynamic temperature effect.

**Activation Overpotentials (Butler–Volmer Kinetics):** When current flows, the cell voltage drops due to kinetic activation losses at the anode and cathode. An activation overpotential $\eta_{\text{act}}$ at each electrode drives the charge-transfer reaction by overcoming the electrochemical reaction barrier ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=contribution%20of%20the%20losses,31%5D.%2035)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=They%20are%20the%20result%20of,31)). The Butler–Volmer equation relates the local reaction current density _i_ (A/m²) to the overpotential at an electrode interface:

$$i \;=\; i_0 \Big[\exp\!\Big(\frac{\alpha_a F\,\eta_{\text{act}}}{RT}\Big)\;-\;\exp\!\Big(\frac{-\,\alpha_c F\,\eta_{\text{act}}}{RT}\Big)\Big] \tag{2}$$

Here $i_0$ is the exchange current density (reflecting reaction rate at equilibrium), and $\alpha_a$, $\alpha_c$ are anodic and cathodic charge transfer coefficients (often $\alpha_a+\alpha_c\approx1$). This general form applies to both anode (hydrogen oxidation) and cathode (oxygen reduction) reactions ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=each%20species%20,%E2%88%92)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=activation%20overpotential%20for%20both%20anode,%F0%9D%91%9DH2O%20%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%292)). For the hydrogen anode (which is usually fast), $i_{0,\text{anode}}$ is large, so $\eta_{\text{act,anode}}$ is small; for the oxygen cathode, $i_{0,\text{cathode}}$ is many orders lower, so the cathodic activation loss dominates. Equation (2) can be simplified in certain regimes: at high anodic overpotential (or if one exponential term is negligible) it reduces to the Tafel equation. For example, if the cathodic term is dominant (oxygen reduction, $\alpha_c \approx 0$ assumption), one obtains a Tafel slope form: $\eta_{\text{act,cathode}} \approx \frac{RT}{\alpha_a F}\ln!\frac{i}{i_0}$ ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=contribution%20of%20the%20losses,31%5D.%2035)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=They%20are%20the%20result%20of,31)). In practice, separate Butler–Volmer expressions can be written for each electrode including reactant concentrations. For instance, the cathode kinetics may include an $O_2$ concentration term (partial pressure $p_{O_2}$) since $i_0$ scales with $O_2$ availability ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=activation%20overpotential%20for%20both%20anode,%F0%9D%91%9DH2O%20%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%292)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%283%29%20%F0%9D%91%96%20%3D%20%F0%9D%91%960%2C%F0%9D%91%90%20,)). A typical PEM cathode kinetics model is:

$$i \;=\; i_{0,c}\Bigg[\Big(\frac{p_{O_2}}{p^0}\Big)^{\!\!m}\exp\!\Big(\frac{\alpha_c F\,\eta_{\text{cath}}}{RT}\Big)\;-\;\exp\!\Big(\frac{- (1-\alpha_c)F\,\eta_{\text{cath}}}{RT}\Big)\Bigg] ,\tag{3}$$

with $m\approx0.5$ for a first-order dependence on $O_2$ (since O2 is diatomic) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%283%29%20%F0%9D%91%96%20%3D%20%F0%9D%91%960%2C%F0%9D%91%90%20,)). Similarly, the anode kinetics can include $p_{H_2}$ dependence. These activation overpotentials appear as $V_{\text{act,anode}}$ and $V_{\text{act,cath}}$ drops in the cell voltage balance.

**Ohmic Losses:** Ohmic overpotential $\eta_{\text{ohm}}$ arises from resistive losses in the ionic and electronic conducting parts of the cell, primarily the membrane ionic resistance and the electronic resistances of electrodes and bipolar plates. Ohmic loss is often modeled by Ohm’s law: $\eta_{\text{ohm}} = I \cdot R_{\text{eq}}$, where $I$ is cell current and $R_{\text{eq}}$ the equivalent internal resistance (Ω) of the cell. In terms of current density _i_ (A/m²), $\eta_{\text{ohm}} = i \cdot (t_{\text{mem}}/\kappa_{\text{mem}} + R_{\text{elec}})$, where $t_{\text{mem}}$ is membrane thickness and $\kappa_{\text{mem}}$ its conductivity (S/m), and $R_{\text{elec}}$ lumps other resistances (e.g. gas diffusion layer, contact resistances) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=Practically%2C%20is%20evaluated%20the%20water,anode%20and%20cathode%20catalyst%20layer)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=than%20is%20made%20the%20mean,final%20integration%20in%20made%2037)). The membrane conductivity depends strongly on water content and temperature; e.g. a well-hydrated Nafion at 80 °C might have $\kappa_{\text{mem}}\sim 0.1$ S/cm, whereas a dry membrane’s conductivity drops significantly ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=,membrane%20ion%20Conductivity) ). We will detail water-dependent conductivity in _Section 3_.

**Mass Transport (Concentration) Losses:** At high current, reactant consumption can cause concentration gradients and depletion near the electrodes, leading to an additional overpotential known as concentration or mass-transport polarization. When the reactant supply rate cannot meet the demand, the local partial pressure (or concentration) at the catalyst drops, effectively lowering the cell voltage. A common expression for the concentration overpotential is derived from the Nernst equation under depleted conditions. For example, assuming a limiting current density $i_L$ (when reactant at the interface goes to zero), the loss can be written as ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=As%20soon%20as%20the%20a,current%20are%20the%20Activation%20Losses)):

$$\eta_{\text{conc}} = -\frac{RT}{nF}\ln\!\Big(1 - \frac{i}{i_L}\Big) . \tag{4}$$

Here $n$ is electrons per reaction (2 for H2, 4 for O2 in PEMFC). This formula (the inverse of Nernst’s log term) captures the rapid voltage fall as $i$ approaches $i_L$. In practical models, $i_L$ can be estimated from mass transport limitations (e.g. diffusion in the gas diffusion layer). Concentration overpotential is more pronounced at the cathode (oxygen side) due to slower $O_2$ diffusion and lower concentration in air, and is exacerbated by flooding (liquid water blocking pores).

**Overall Cell Voltage:** Combining these contributions, the instantaneous cell voltage under load is given by the balance:

$$V_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{rev}} - \eta_{\text{act, anode}} - \eta_{\text{act, cathode}} - \eta_{\text{ohm}} - \eta_{\text{conc}} . \tag{5}$$

This applies under steady-state conditions for a single cell ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=As%20soon%20as%20the%20a,current%20are%20the%20Activation%20Losses)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=to%20three%20types%20of%20losses%3A,maintain%20the%20reactions%20at%20the)). In a stack of $N_{\text{cell}}$ cells (series connection), $V_{\text{stack}} = N_{\text{cell}},V_{\text{cell}}$ ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=Practically%2C%20is%20evaluated%20the%20water,anode%20and%20cathode%20catalyst%20layer)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=than%20is%20made%20the%20mean,final%20integration%20in%20made%2037)). Equation (5) is often used to plot polarization curves (voltage vs. current density), showing the activation-controlled region (low i), ohmic linear region (moderate i), and diffusion-limited region (near $i_L$) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=to%20three%20types%20of%20losses%3A,maintain%20the%20reactions%20at%20the)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=ohmic%20losses,In%20fact%2C%20to%20overcome)).

**Faraday’s Efficiency (Fuel Utilization):** Not all the current may go into the desired electrochemical reaction. _Faradaic efficiency_ (or _current efficiency_) $\eta_F$ measures the fraction of the applied current that produces the target reaction products. In a PEM fuel cell, losses like hydrogen crossover or internal currents waste some reactant without generating external current, lowering the effective fuel utilization ([Introducing a Novel Technique for Measuring Hydrogen Crossover in Membrane-Based Electrochemical Cells](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774854#:~:text=diffuses%20to%20the%20anode,the%20most%20commonly%20used%20hydrogen)) ([Cathode Catalyst Layer Design in PEM Water Electrolysis toward Reduced Pt Loading and Hydrogen Crossover | ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.4c01827#:~:text=lowers%20the%20faradaic%20efficiency%20and,law%20by%20assuming%20an%20equilibrium)). In a PEM electrolyzer, some product hydrogen can permeate to the oxygen side and recombine, wasting input current as heat ([Introducing a Novel Technique for Measuring Hydrogen Crossover in Membrane-Based Electrochemical Cells](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774854#:~:text=diffuses%20to%20the%20anode,the%20most%20commonly%20used%20hydrogen)). Faraday’s efficiency can be defined as:

$$\eta_F = \frac{\text{actual reaction current}}{\text{total current}} = 1 - \frac{i_{\text{loss}}}{i} \tag{6}$$

where $i_{\text{loss}}$ is the parasitic current density corresponding to side reactions or crossover. For example, if $J_{H_2,\text{xover}}$ is the hydrogen crossover molar flux (mol/m²·s) through the membrane, the **crossover current** density is $i_{\text{xover}} = 2F,J_{H_2,\text{xover}}$ (since 1 H2 carries 2 electrons) ([Introducing a Novel Technique for Measuring Hydrogen Crossover in Membrane-Based Electrochemical Cells](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774854#:~:text=diffuses%20to%20the%20anode,the%20most%20commonly%20used%20hydrogen)). Then $\eta_F = 1 - i_{\text{xover}}/i$. A high-quality membrane (thicker or less permeable) and lower differential pressure improve $\eta_F$ by reducing crossover ([Introducing a Novel Technique for Measuring Hydrogen Crossover in Membrane-Based Electrochemical Cells](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774854#:~:text=diffuses%20to%20the%20anode,the%20most%20commonly%20used%20hydrogen)) ([Cathode Catalyst Layer Design in PEM Water Electrolysis toward Reduced Pt Loading and Hydrogen Crossover | ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.4c01827#:~:text=lowers%20the%20faradaic%20efficiency%20and,law%20by%20assuming%20an%20equilibrium)). In practice, Faraday efficiency in modern PEM electrolyzers can exceed 98–99% at high current density, but drops at low loads or high pressure due to increased crossover ([Faraday’s Efficiency Modeling of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer Based on Experimental Data](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4792#:~:text=match%20at%20L604%20produced%20and,be%20generated%20according%20to%20the)) ([Faraday’s Efficiency Modeling of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer Based on Experimental Data](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4792#:~:text=match%20at%20L642%20been%20carried,current%20and%20hydrogen%20pressure%20on)). Faradaic losses manifest as a lower observed hydrogen production (or lower fuel cell current for a given fuel feed) and appear as an efficiency loss rather than a direct voltage term. They are nonetheless crucial in dynamic modeling, as any current not producing useful output ends up as heat and can affect thermal management (discussed next).

# 2. Mass Transport Equations

**Continuity and Convection:** Mass transport in a PEM cell involves convection in flow channels and diffusion through porous media. For each species (H2, O2, H2O, etc.), conservation of mass is described by a continuity equation. In a differential form, for species _k_:

$$\frac{\partial (\varepsilon \rho_k)}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\varepsilon \mathbf{u}\,\rho_k) = \nabla\cdot(\varepsilon D_{\text{eff},k}\nabla \rho_k) + S_k, \tag{7}$$

where $\rho_k$ is the mass (or molar) density of species _k_, $\varepsilon$ is porosity (so $\varepsilon \rho_k$ is the density in pores) and $\mathbf{u}$ is the flow velocity ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=where%20%CE%B5%20is%20the%20porosity,of%20water%20in%20the%20cathode) ). The left side represents accumulation and convection; the right side includes diffusion (with effective diffusivity $D_{\text{eff},k}$ in porous media) and a source term $S_k$ for generation/consumption ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=channels%2C%20%CF%81%20the%20density%2C%20and,of%20water%20in%20the%20cathode) ). In gas channels, $\varepsilon=1$ (open flow). In porous electrodes, $\varepsilon$ is the void fraction (typically 0.3–0.7), and $\varepsilon \mathbf{u}$ represents the _superficial_ velocity through pores ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ). The source term $S_k$ accounts for electrochemical reactions: for example, in a fuel cell anode $S_{\text{H}_2}=-\dot{n}_{H_2} M_{H_2}$ (hydrogen is consumed), while in the cathode $S_{\text{O}_2}=-\dot{n}_{O_2} M_{O_2}$ and $S_{\text{H}_2O,\text{prod}}=+\dot{n}_{H_2O} M_{H_2O}$ (water is produced). Here $\dot{n}_{i}$ (mol/m³·s) are reaction rates. Stoichiometrically, $\dot{n}_{H_2} = i/(2F)$ and $\dot{n}_{O_2}=i/(4F)$ per unit catalyst area, and these are distributed over the volume of the reaction layer in a full model ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=channels%2C%20%CF%81%20the%20density%2C%20and,of%20water%20in%20the%20cathode) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=Here%2C%20k%20denotes%20chemical%20species,k%7D%20denotes) ). The source terms appear in both the mass and species equations and couple the electrochemical kinetics to mass transport. Under steady state, the left-hand time derivative is zero, but in transient conditions this partial differential equation (PDE) governs how quickly concentration profiles respond to changes in load or flow.

**Convective Flow in Channels:** In the flow channels, hydrogen and oxygen (or air) are typically delivered under laminar flow (Re <~ 1000). The momentum equation (Navier–Stokes) for incompressible flow is used, often simplified to a unidirectional flow with known pressure drop. The general form is ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ):

$$\rho (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{F}_{\text{drag}}, \tag{8}$$

with $\mu$ the dynamic viscosity and $\mathbf{F}_{\text{drag}}$ a drag term added to represent flow through porous media (Darcy’s law). In the channels, $\mathbf{F}_{\text{drag}}=0$; in the gas diffusion layer or catalyst layer, a Darcy drag term $-\frac{\mu}{K}\mathbf{u}$ is included (with $K$ the permeability, m²) to model the resistance of the porous material ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=catalyst%20layer%20and%20membrane,in%20the%20equation%20as%20follows) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=added%20based%20on%20the%20Darcy%27s,in%20the%20equation%20as%20follows) ). Often the flow in porous regions is assumed to obey Darcy’s law directly: $\mathbf{u} = -(K/\mu)\nabla p$. The pressure-driven convection in porous media is usually much smaller than diffusive transport for gases, so many PEM models neglect bulk flow in the GDL and assume diffusion-dominated transport there ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=catalyst%20layer%20and%20membrane,in%20the%20equation%20as%20follows) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=added%20based%20on%20the%20Darcy%27s,in%20the%20equation%20as%20follows) ).

**Diffusive Transport in Porous Electrodes:** Hydrogen and oxygen must diffuse from the flow channels through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer to reach the reaction sites. Fick’s law gives the molar flux $\mathbf{N}_i$ of species _i_ (mol/m²·s):

$$\mathbf{N}_i = -D_{\text{eff},i}\,\nabla C_i, \tag{9}$$

where $C_i$ is concentration (mol/m³). In a steady-state one-dimensional approximation through the thickness _L_ of a layer, $N_i = D_{\text{eff},i}(C_{i,\text{channel}} - C_{i,\text{interface}})/L$. The **effective diffusivity** $D_{\text{eff},i}$ in the porous medium is reduced from the bulk gas diffusivity $D_{i}$ by the porosity–tortuosity of the medium: a common approximation is $D_{\text{eff}} = \varepsilon D/\tau$ ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=2%F0%9D%9B%BC%F0%9D%91%90%F0%9D%90%B9%20%F0%9D%9C%82%F0%9D%91%82%F0%9D%91%85%F0%9D%91%85%20%F0%9D%91%85%F0%9D%91%87%20,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%E2%88%92%20%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%A5%F0%9D%91%9D%20,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)). Alternatively, $D_{\text{eff}}$ is correlated by a **Bruggeman relation** $D_{\text{eff}} = D ,\varepsilon^b$ with exponent $b≈1.5$ for many fibrous media (accounting for tortuosity) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%290,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%E2%88%92%20%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%A5%F0%9D%91%9D%20,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)). For example, a GDL with porosity 0.6 and $b=1.5$ would have $D_{\text{eff}}\approx0.6^{1.5} \approx 0.464$ times the bulk diffusion coefficient. The diffusion of gas in the catalyst layer can be additionally hindered by ionomer presence and smaller pores; multi-component diffusion (Stefan–Maxwell) may be considered if high water vapor content or inert gases (N2) are present. Typically, one defines a **limiting current** $i_L$ from the diffusion rate: e.g. $i_{L,\text{O2}} = 4F,N_{\text{O2,max}}$ where $N_{\text{O2,max}} = D_{\text{eff,O2}}(C_{O2,\text{channel}}-0)/L$ is the max O₂ flux if O₂ at the catalyst goes to zero. This links back to the concentration overpotential (Eq. 4).

**Water Transport and Crossover:** Water is a key species to track. In a PEM _fuel cell_, water is produced at the cathode catalyst layer and removed via gas flow (some may condense to liquid at lower temperatures or high humidity). In a PEM _electrolyzer_, water is a reactant (typically fed to the anode) and is consumed to form oxygen, while excess water and produced hydrogen are removed at the cathode side. Water can **crossover** through the membrane via multiple mechanisms: _electro-osmotic drag_, _back-diffusion_, and hydraulic permeation. In this section we consider the mass transport aspects; the next section will detail water balance in the membrane. Electro-osmotic drag refers to water molecules carried along with protons across the membrane from anode to cathode (in a PEMFC, from anode→cathode; reverse in an AEMFC). This manifests as a water flux $N_{\text{osm}}$ (mol/m²·s) proportional to the proton current:

$$N_{\text{osm}} = \frac{n_d\, i}{F}\ , \tag{10}
$$
where $n_d$ is the electro-osmotic drag coefficient (number of H₂O molecules dragged per proton) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Electro,7%5D%3A%20Nosmotic%20%3D%20nd)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=where%20F%20is%20the%20Faraday%E2%80%99s,drag%20coeffi%02cient%3A%20nd%20%3D%20%EF%A3%B1)). Typical $n_d$ for Nafion is in the range 1 to 3, increasing with membrane hydration ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Electro,7%5D%3A%20Nosmotic%20%3D%20nd)). Back-diffusion is the diffusive flux of water down a concentration gradient; e.g. in a fuel cell, if the cathode side is very moist, water will diffuse back toward the anode. A diffusive water flux can be written analogously to Fick’s law:

$$N_{\text{diff}} = -D_w\,\frac{dC_w}{dx} \tag{11}$$

(where $C_w$ is water concentration in the membrane). Sometimes it’s written in terms of water content $λ$ (number of water molecules per sulfonic acid group) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ):

$$N_{\text{diff}} = -\,\frac{D_\lambda \,\rho_{\text{dry}}}{EW}\,\frac{dλ}{dx} , \tag{12}$$

with $\rho_{\text{dry}}$ the dry membrane density and $EW$ the equivalent weight (kg/mol of sulfonic acid) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ). This form converts $∇λ$ to a concentration gradient ($\rho_{\text{dry}}/EW$ is mol sulfonic sites per volume). $D_w$ (or $D_λ$) strongly depends on hydration; empirical fits are used ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=equivalent%20weight%2C%20and%20z%20is,direction%20through%20the%20membrane%20thickness) ). **Hydraulic crossover** occurs if there's a pressure difference across the membrane (especially in PEM electrolyzers where one side may be liquid-fed). This is modeled by Darcy’s law for flow through a porous medium:

$$N_{\text{hyd}} = -\frac{K_{\text{mem}}}{\mu_w}\,\Delta p \tag{13}$$

($K_{\text{mem}}$ is an effective permeability of the membrane to water, and $\mu_w$ water viscosity). Darcy-driven water flux is generally small in PEM fuel cells (membranes are nearly impermeable to liquid water), but in _water electrolyzers_ with thin membranes at high differential pressure, it can contribute to additional hydrogen crossover (pressurized water forcing H2 across). All these mechanisms together determine net water crossover and distribution, which are crucial for maintaining membrane hydration without flooding.

**Transient Behavior:** The mass transport equations can be applied in transient simulations to predict how quickly a cell responds to changes. For instance,<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> when load current suddenly increases, hydrogen and oxygen consumption jump, leading to a transient dip in partial pressures until the flow and diffusion catch up. Equation (7) with the time derivative term captures this, and one can solve it numerically (often with finite-volume methods) to find species concentration as a function of time and position </mark>( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=2) ). Dynamic models show that thin gas diffusion layers and higher flow rates reduce response time by facilitating faster transport of reactants and removal of products.

# 3. Thermal Effects and Water Management

**Heat Generation and Balance:** A PEM cell generates heat from multiple sources: (i) the reaction enthalpy that is not converted to electrical work, and (ii) Joule heating from ohmic losses, and (iii) any heat of mixing or phase change (e.g. water evaporation/condensation). The overall reaction (H2 + ½O2 → H2O) is exothermic with reaction enthalpy ΔH ≈ –286 kJ/mol (liquid water) at 25 °C ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=of%20reactants%20and%20products%20play,RT%202F%20ln%20A%20aH2)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=aH2O%20B%20%281,22)). The Gibbs free energy ΔG ≈ –237 kJ/mol corresponds to the maximum electrical work (which yields the 1.23 V), so the difference ΔH–ΔG (~49 kJ/mol) is released as heat even at open circuit ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%88%86G%20nF%20%3D%201,in%20changing%20the%20output%20potential)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=0%20%2B%20RT%202F%20ln,7)). Under load, additional losses (activation and ohmic) convert electrical energy to heat. Therefore, the heat generation rate (W) in a single cell can be expressed as:

$$Q_{\text{gen}} = I \big( \Delta H/2F - V_{\text{cell}} \big) + I^2 R_{\text{eq}}, \tag{14}$$

where $I(\Delta H/2F)$ is the total chemical energy input per second (for reaction at current $I$), $I V_{\text{cell}}$ is the electric power output, and the difference is the reaction heat. The $I^2R$ term adds Joule heating. In a more detailed model, one would integrate local heat sources in the catalyst layer (from activation overpotentials) and in the membrane (ohmic losses) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=While%20many%20modeling%20parameters%20are,which%20can%20be%20calculated%20by)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=2,1)). Transient thermal behavior is governed by an energy conservation equation. For a lumped cell mass $m$ with heat capacity $C_p$, one can write:

$$m C_p \frac{dT}{dt} = Q_{\text{gen}} - Q_{\text{cool}} - Q_{\text{env}}, \tag{15}$$

where $Q_{\text{cool}}$ is heat removed by coolant (if liquid cooled or by conduction to heat sink) and $Q_{\text{env}}$ is losses to ambient (convection, radiation). Steady-state is reached when generation equals removal. In stack designs, cooling channels or plates are used to dissipate heat and maintain uniform temperature. Non-uniform temperature can cause dry spots or flooding in different areas, so thermal management aims to keep the cell at an optimal temperature (often ~60–80 °C for PEMFC) ([A One-Dimensional Heat, Mass and Charge Transfer Model for a Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Stack](https://www.fuelcellstore.com/blog-section/membrane-information/heat-mass-charger-transfer-model-pem-fuel-cell#:~:text=optimization%20of%20charge%20transport%20through,If%20too%20much%20water%20is)) ([A One-Dimensional Heat, Mass and Charge Transfer Model for a Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Stack](https://www.fuelcellstore.com/blog-section/membrane-information/heat-mass-charger-transfer-model-pem-fuel-cell#:~:text=change%2C%20coolant%20temperature%2C%20air%20convection%2C,If%20too%20much%20water%20is)). Numerical models often solve a heat conduction equation through the cell layers (with source terms for heat) coupled with convective heat removal by gas flows or a coolant. For example, a 1D thermal model might solve $k \frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} + Q_{\text{gen,vol}} = 0$ in steady state (with $k$ thermal conductivity) to find the temperature gradient across the cell ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=Energy%20Conversion%20and%20Management%20273,coupling%20behaviors%2C%20and%20computational%20strategies)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=used%20in%20this%20model%20are,%F0%9D%91%89%F0%9D%91%90%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%99%F0%9D%91%99%20%3D%20%F0%9D%90%B8%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%A3%20%E2%88%92%20%E2%88%91)). In transient, a time-dependent term $\rho C_p \partial T/\partial t$ would be included.

**Membrane Water Content and Transport:** Proper hydration of the membrane is critical for conductivity, but excess liquid water can flood electrodes. Water management modeling typically tracks the **water content** $λ(x,t)$ in the membrane (mol H2O per sulfonic acid group). The water balance in the membrane involves electro-osmotic drag from anode to cathode, back-diffusion from cathode to anode, and any net production or consumption at the interfaces ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=2) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=Water%20management%20is%20a%20critical,layer%20due%20to%20electrochemical%20reaction) ). A steady-state water flux balance across the membrane equates drag and diffusion (plus any hydraulic permeation). In transient conditions, one can write a diffusion-convection equation for water in the membrane similar to Eq. (7). Springer _et al._’s classical model ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=2) ) gave a diffusion equation for $λ(z)$ through the membrane thickness _tmem_:

$$\frac{d}{dz}\!\Big(-D_\lambda(λ)\,\frac{dλ}{dz} - n_d(λ)\frac{i}{F}\Big) = 0, \tag{16}$$

which at steady state integrates to $-D_\lambda,dλ/dz = n_d,i/F + \text{const}$. The terms represent back-diffusion (first term) and electro-osmotic drag (second term) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=%23%201%29.%20Electro) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ). $n_d(λ)$ is the drag coefficient, which increases with $λ$ (more hydrated membrane drags more water). Empirical fits for Nafion report, e.g., $n_d = 0.0029,λ^2 + 0.05λ$ (for $λ>0$) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Electro,7%5D%3A%20Nosmotic%20%3D%20nd)). This gives $n_d≈2.5$ at high $λ$ (~14), meaning 2–3 water molecules per proton ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Electro,7%5D%3A%20Nosmotic%20%3D%20nd)). The diffusion coefficient of water in the membrane, $D_w$ or $D_λ$, also depends on hydration; a typical correlation is $D_w(λ) = 10^{-6}\exp(2416(1/303 - 1/T))$ in m²/s order of magnitude, increasing sharply with $λ$ ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=equivalent%20weight%2C%20and%20z%20is,direction%20through%20the%20membrane%20thickness) ). Boundary conditions for Eq. (16) relate $λ$ at the membrane surfaces to the water activity in adjacent catalyst layers. Water activity $a_k$ at an electrode is the ratio of $p_{\text{H}_2O}$ to $p_{\text{H}_2O}^\text{sat}(T)$ ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=where%20%CE%BB%20represents%20water%20contend,of%20the%20membrane%20described%20as) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=where%20a_,expressed%20as) ). The membrane surface in contact with a gas of certain humidity will equilibriate to a corresponding $λ$. For instance, $λ_{\text{anode}}(a_{\text{H}_2O,an})$ can be obtained from sorption isotherms (Nafion can take up $λ\approx14$ at 100% RH and 30 °C). Thus, given inlet humidities, one can solve for the $λ$ profile across the membrane. This is often done numerically by finite differences or shooting methods, as the coefficients $n_d(λ)$ and $D(λ)$ make the equation nonlinear ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=2) ). The result predicts membrane hydration and informs conductivity (since ionic conductivity $\sigma_{\text{mem}}$ is a function of $λ$). A well-hydrated membrane has high $\sigma$ (e.g. 0.1 S/cm); if $λ$ drops (dry membrane), $\sigma$ falls and ohmic losses rise steeply ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=,membrane%20ion%20Conductivity) ). Hence, **coupling of water and thermal management**: higher temperature helps kinetics but can dry the membrane if humidity is not sufficient, increasing ohmic loss and heat.

**Electro-Osmotic Drag & Diffusion Equations:** The electro-osmotic drag flux was given by Eq. (10). The total molar water flux from anode to cathode through the membrane is $N_{\text{mem}} = N_{\text{osm}} + N_{\text{hyd}} + N_{\text{diff}}$. In a fuel cell at steady state, typically $N_{\text{osm}}$ from anode to cathode is partially balanced by $N_{\text{diff}}$ back to anode. If anode is fully humidified and cathode relatively dry, $N_{\text{diff}}$ may dominate in the opposite direction. These fluxes influence water **balance** at each electrode: for example, at the cathode side, water production plus incoming $N_{\text{osm}}$ minus outgoing $N_{\text{diff}}$ determines net water accumulation or removal by flow. One can write water mass balances for the anode and cathode channels including sources from the membrane. Proper water management ensures the anode does not dry out (especially important in dead-ended anode operation for fuel cells) and the cathode does not flood (excess liquid water causing blockage). Models often include a **two-phase** water model in the cathode GDL: when local vapor concentration exceeds saturation, liquid water forms. Capillary pressure and liquid permeability then govern the removal of liquid water. While the question focuses on the membrane module, it’s worth noting that _flooding_ is handled by adding terms for liquid water saturation _s_ and using Darcy’s law for liquid transport in the porous media. For example, the relative diffusivity of gas is multiplied by $(1-s)^{!3}$ (Bruggeman-type) to account for blockage by liquid water ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%290,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%E2%88%92%20%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%A5%F0%9D%91%9D%20,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)). Thermal effects tie in because a hotter cell can carry more water vapor (higher $p_{\text{sat}}$) before condensing, and evaporation/condensation themselves absorb/release heat (latent heat), affecting the thermal balance.

**Transient Thermal-Water Coupling:** During transient operation, heat capacity of the cell causes temperature to lag behind current changes. A sudden increase in current generates more heat and also more water at the cathode (or consumes more water in an electrolyzer). The membrane might heat up, reducing its water content if humidity is fixed, which in turn lowers conductivity and can further heat the membrane (a positive feedback if not managed). Advanced models include this coupling by solving time-dependent equations for both $T(x,t)$ and $λ(x,t)$. The electro-osmotic drag may temporarily dehydrate the anode side of the membrane until back-diffusion catches up ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=The%20water%20formation%20at%20the,expressed%20as%20following%20water%20flux) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=gradient%20causes%20a%20water%20flux,expressed%20as%20following%20water%20flux) ). Numerical simulation is typically required for such coupled transient behavior, using time-stepping to solve the energy equation (15) together with water diffusion/drag equations. In summary, thermal management and water management are intimately linked: maintaining optimal membrane hydration and temperature is critical for steady performance and longevity of the PEM system.

# 4. Geometrical Parameters

The geometry of the PEM electrochemical cell (or stack) enters the model through parameters like cell area, layer thicknesses, and flow field design. These geometrical factors often appear in the equations as scaling factors or path lengths:

- **Cell Active Area (A):** This is the electrode area available for reaction (in cm² or m²). The total cell current is $I = j \cdot A$, where _j_ (A/m²) is the current density. A larger area allows higher total currents for a given current density. Geometric area also influences ohmic resistance (a larger cross-sectional area for current reduces resistance: $R_{\text{mem}} = \rho_{\text{mem}} t_{\text{mem}}/A$) and the rate of heat removal (large area can dissipate more heat to flowing gases or coolant) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=Practically%2C%20is%20evaluated%20the%20water,anode%20and%20cathode%20catalyst%20layer)) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=than%20is%20made%20the%20mean,final%20integration%20in%20made%2037)). In modeling, area comes in when integrating local current densities or scaling up single-cell results to stack level.
    
- **Electrode and Membrane Thickness:** Thicker electrodes (GDL or catalyst layer) provide longer pathways for mass transport and charge conduction. In diffusion equations, the thickness _L_ appears in the gradient or as a length scale (e.g. Fick’s law flux $\sim D_{\text{eff}}(C_{\text{chan}}-C_{\text{int}})/L$). Thicker GDLs can cause higher concentration overpotentials at high current due to longer diffusion paths (and slightly higher in-plane resistance for electron flow). Catalyst layer thickness must balance having enough catalyst/electrolyte interface versus mass transport limits; typical CL thickness is only ~5–20 μm. The **membrane thickness** strongly affects ohmic loss and water crossover. A thicker membrane increases ionic path length (linearly raising $\eta_{\text{ohm}}$) but also reduces gas crossover and improves durability. For example, increasing Nafion membrane thickness from 25 μm to 125 μm can cut crossover by ~80%, improving Faraday efficiency ([Introducing a Novel Technique for Measuring Hydrogen Crossover in Membrane-Based Electrochemical Cells](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774854#:~:text=diffuses%20to%20the%20anode,the%20most%20commonly%20used%20hydrogen)). However, a very thick membrane may require higher compression and can increase the cell’s internal resistance, so an optimal thickness is chosen. In dynamic models, the membrane thickness _tmem_ also affects the water diffusion time constant (roughly $t_{\text{mem}}^2/D_w$).
    
- **Number of Flow Channels:** The flow field design (e.g. number of channels, channel width, and length) influences pressure drop and reactant distribution. More channels (or wider channels) in parallel result in lower pressure drop but also lower flow velocity, which might reduce convective removal of water. Fewer channels (or longer serpentine paths) ensure reactants travel across the whole area but at the cost of higher pressure drop and possibly uneven distribution if channels are very long. In modeling, the _channel count_ and layout can be accounted for by either simulating each channel or using an effective 1D approximation with a certain stoichiometric flow rate and pressure drop correlation. The number of channels and their spacing also determine the land areas (where gas must diffuse laterally under a land). For instance, a **serpentine** flow field with one long channel ensures uniform flow but is often modeled in segments; a **parallel** multi-channel design may need a 2D model to capture flow maldistribution if any. Geometrical parameters like channel hydraulic diameter and length are used in computing Reynolds number and friction factor for flow (to get pressure drop, which affects the inlet pressure to the Nernst equation via $p_{H2}, p_{O2}$). While detailed CFD is beyond scope, one can include empirical channel models (e.g. Hagen–Poiseuille flow in rectangular channels for pressure vs flow).
    
- **Bipolar Plate and Separator Thickness:** These affect the volume and weight of the stack and also the thermal conduction path. A thicker graphite or metal bipolar plate (which includes channels) can carry heat away more uniformly but adds resistance if it’s not highly conductive. In modeling, plate thickness might be included in a thermal circuit – for example, modeling the through-plane thermal resistance as a stack of layers (catalyst layer, GDL, plate, etc.) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=J,A)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=processes%2C%20and%20equivalent%20thermal%20resistance,presented%20in%20the%20succeeding%20subsections)). A thicker plate also increases the distance between cells if cooling channels are integrated. Typically, flow field plates are a few millimeters thick; their thickness doesn’t directly enter electrochemical equations, but if one is modeling the _stack compression_, it could impact contact resistance (thicker, stiffer plates distribute pressure differently).
    

In summary, geometric parameters set the **physical scales** in the model. They do not change the fundamental equations but provide the dimensions for transport processes. In numerical models, the cell may be discretized across these thicknesses. For instance, a one-dimensional through-plane model will have grid points spanning the GDL thickness, membrane thickness, etc., proportional to their actual values ( [Performance Characteristics of a PEM Fuel Cell with Parallel Flow Channels at Different Cathode Relative Humidity Levels - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3260633/#:~:text=A%20schematic%20of%20the%20micro,7%20%28%CE%BCm%29%2C%20respectively) ) ( [Performance Characteristics of a PEM Fuel Cell with Parallel Flow Channels at Different Cathode Relative Humidity Levels - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3260633/#:~:text=is%20762%20%C3%97%20762%20,7%20%28%CE%BCm%29%2C%20respectively) ). Transient responses in larger cells might also show slight spatial non-uniformity if geometry is large (e.g. edges cooler than center). Engineers use geometric modeling to optimize channel designs (number, depth, width) to ensure uniform reactant distribution and effective water removal, which can be captured by including multi-dimensional terms in the mass transport equations.

# 5. Electrode Parameters

The porous electrodes (anode and cathode) are characterized by properties that affect reaction kinetics and mass transport. Key parameters include thickness (already discussed), porosity, tortuosity, pore size, electrical/ionic conductivity, and electrochemically active surface area:

- **Porosity (ε):** This is the fraction of void volume in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) or catalyst layer (CL). A higher porosity means more open space for gas to flow and diffuse. In the species transport equations, porosity appears as $\varepsilon$ multiplying gas density and diffusion terms (Eq. 7) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=where%20%CE%B5%20is%20the%20porosity,of%20water%20in%20the%20cathode) ). It directly influences the effective diffusivity ($D_{\text{eff}} = \varepsilon D/\tau$) and permeability $K$ in Darcy’s law. Typical GDL porosity ~0.6–0.8, CL porosity ~0.3–0.6 (CL has pores within catalyst + ionomer). Porosity is often a design trade-off: too high porosity reduces mechanical support and may flood easily; too low porosity hinders gas transport.
    
- **Tortuosity (τ):** This dimensionless factor (>1) accounts for the convoluted path gas must take through the pores. A common model is the **Bruggeman correlation**, relating tortuosity to porosity by $τ ≈ ε^{-b}$ with $b≈0.5$ for straight pores or $~1.5$ for more complex structures. Effective diffusivity can be written $D_{\text{eff}} = D \frac{ε}{τ}$ ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%290,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%E2%88%92%20%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%A5%F0%9D%91%9D%20,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)); for example, if $ε=0.5$ and $τ=2$, then $D_{\text{eff}}=0.25 D$. Tortuosity also affects effective ionic conductivity in the catalyst layer (protons moving through ionomer phase) and electron conduction in porous media with binder. Many models include τ implicitly by fitting $D_{\text{eff}}$ or using empirical diffusivity measurements ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%290,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)).
    
- **Pore Radius and Capillarity:** The average pore radius (and pore size distribution) influences how liquid water forms and moves. According to the Washburn equation, the capillary pressure $p_c$ in a pore is $p_c = \frac{-2γ \cosθ}{r_{\text{pore}}}$, where $γ$ is surface tension and $θ$ the contact angle. Smaller pores have higher capillary pressure, meaning they hold water more tightly (harder to drain, leading to flooding if produced water accumulates). Electrode designs often use hydrophobic treatments (e.g. PTFE coating) to increase contact angle and help expel water. In modeling, pore size and wettability come into play in two-phase water models: e.g. one may set a capillary pressure vs saturation relation $p_c(s)$ to simulate how pores fill with water as $s$ rises ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%283%29%20%F0%9D%91%96%20%3D%20%F0%9D%91%960%2C%F0%9D%91%90%20,)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%290,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)). While detailed two-phase modeling is complex, a simpler “flooding resistance” can be included: for instance, an empirical reduction in $i_L$ or $D_{\text{eff}}$ when current (and hence water production) exceeds a threshold.
    
- **Electrical Resistivity:** The electrodes must conduct electrons (in the GDL and through the carbon catalyst support) and protons (in the ionomer within the catalyst layer). The GDL is usually a carbon paper or cloth; its through-plane resistivity contributes to $R_{\text{eq}}$. Similarly, the catalyst layer contains carbon and ionomer; its **ionic resistivity** (proton pathway through ionomer) can cause additional voltage loss, sometimes called _charge transport resistance_ in the CL ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=electrodes%20are%20not%20strictly%20ohmic,of%20the%20effective%20ionic%20resistance)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=entire%20current%20density%2C%20while%20the,inherent%20water%20imbalance%20in%20an)). Models often include an **electronic resistance** for the GDL ($R_{\text{GDL}}$) and an **ionic resistance** for the catalyst layer ($R_{\text{CL}}$). $R_{\text{CL}}$ can be modeled by considering the CL thickness, ionomer volume fraction, and conductivity of the ionomer (which depends on hydration). If the catalyst layer is thin and well hydrated, this may be small, but if the CL dries, ionic resistivity increases and can severely limit performance at high current ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=electrodes%20are%20not%20strictly%20ohmic,of%20the%20effective%20ionic%20resistance)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=entire%20current%20density%2C%20while%20the,inherent%20water%20imbalance%20in%20an)). Including these resistances, the ohmic overpotential is $\eta_{\text{ohm}} = i (t_{\text{mem}}/\kappa_{\text{mem}} + t_{\text{CL}}/\kappa_{\text{ion,CL}} + R_{\text{GDL,elec}})$, where $\kappa_{\text{ion,CL}}$ is the proton conductivity in the CL ionomer (S/m). For accurate modeling, one might solve separate potentials for proton and electron conduction in the catalyst layer using Ohm’s law ($\nabla \cdot (σ_e \nabla \Phi_e) = -S_{\text{charge}}$, $\nabla \cdot (σ_i \nabla \Phi_i) = +S_{\text{charge}}$) to capture local overpotentials.
    
- **Electrochemically Active Surface Area (ECSA):** This is the real surface area of catalyst accessible for reaction, per unit geometric area (m²_real/m²_geo). A higher ECSA (via finely dispersed Pt nanoparticles, etc.) increases the exchange current density $i_0$ because more reaction sites are available ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=each%20species%20,%E2%88%92)). Often, kinetic parameters are reported per real area (i₀real in A/m²_real); to use in the model, one multiplies by ECSA to get the effective $i_0$ per geometric area. For instance, if a cathode has ECSA = 100 m²_pt per m²_geo and the fundamental exchange current is 0.1 A/m²_pt, the effective $i_{0,\text{cath}}$ in Eq. (2) would be 10 A/m²_geo. ECSA can degrade over time (catalyst sintering or carbon corrosion), effectively lowering $i_0$ and thus increasing activation losses for the same current. Some models include a decay function for ECSA with time or with charge throughput.
    

In summary, electrode parameters feed into the model through **effective transport and kinetic properties**. Porosity and tortuosity modify diffusion and permeability in the mass transport equations. Pore structure and wettability determine how water saturates the electrode, affecting available area for gas flow. Resistivity and connectivity of the solid and ionomer phases influence ohmic losses in the electrodes. And ECSA scales the kinetic current response in the Butler–Volmer equations. When setting up a numerical model, one typically inputs these parameters and uses relations like Bruggeman’s equation or percolation thresholds to compute coefficients used in the governing equations ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%290,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)) ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%E2%88%92%20%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%A5%F0%9D%91%9D%20,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)). For instance, given porosity and pore size, one can compute a Knudsen diffusivity correction for $D_{\text{eff}}$. Electrode thickness combined with diffusivity yields the mass transport resistance that informs $i_L$. All these factors must be tuned (often with experimental validation) for the model to accurately predict polarization curves and transient behavior.

# 6. Membrane Parameters

The PEM (ion-exchange membrane) is the heart of the cell, and its properties critically determine performance. Important membrane parameters include thickness, ionic conductivity (which depends on water content), permeability to gases and water, and durability factors:

- **Thickness (tmem):** As discussed, a thinner membrane reduces ionic resistance (good for performance) but increases gas crossover and may have lower mechanical strength. Nafion membranes come in various thicknesses (e.g. Nafion 212 is 50 μm, Nafion 115 is 127 μm). In the model, _tmem_ appears in ohm’s law for membrane voltage drop ($V_{\text{ohm}} = i \cdot t_{\text{mem}}/\kappa_{\text{mem}}$) and in the diffusion length for water crossover (Eqs. 11–12). Thinner membranes also have lower water uptake capacity (less volume to hold water), which can lead to more rapid drying if water balance isn’t maintained. When modeling stacks, one must also consider that thinner membranes might increase shunt currents (in electrolyzers) due to higher ionic conductivity of leakage paths – though in PEMFC stacks the membrane mainly affects internal cell behavior.
    
- **Equivalent Weight and Water Uptake:** Membranes like Nafion are characterized by equivalent weight (EW, grams of dry polymer per mole of sulfonic acid, typically ~1100 g/mol). The **weight percent of water** or water uptake is often given as a percentage increase in mass from dry to hydrated state, or as the water content $λ$ (mentioned earlier). For example, Nafion 117 (thicker membrane) can absorb ~30% of its weight in water at 100% RH, corresponding to $λ \approx 14$ (14 H₂O/SO₃H) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=where%20%CE%BB%20represents%20water%20contend,of%20the%20membrane%20described%20as) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=where%20a_,expressed%20as) ). In the model, water uptake influences **wetting factor** – effectively how saturated the membrane is. A “wetness factor” could refer to a normalized water content $λ/λ_{\text{max}}$. If the membrane is partially dry, conductivity and $n_d$ drop. Empirical conductivity relations (e.g. $\kappa_{\text{mem}}(λ,T)$ from Springer’s model) are used ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=,membrane%20ion%20Conductivity) ). One such relation for Nafion is $\kappa_{\text{mem}} = (0.005139,λ - 0.00326)\exp!\Big[\frac{1268}{303}\big(1 - \frac{303}{T}\big)\Big]$ (S/cm) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=) ), which shows strong dependence on $λ$ and $T$. Thus, membrane ionic resistance $R_{\text{mem}} = \frac{t_{\text{mem}}}{\kappa_{\text{mem}}(λ,T) A}$ couples to hydration and thermal conditions.
    
- **Gas Diffusivity (H₂ and O₂ crossover):** An ideally operating PEM should be impermeable to gases, but in reality some hydrogen and oxygen can diffuse through the membrane (especially at high pressure or thin membranes). This gas crossover is often quantified by a diffusion coefficient or **permeability** $P = D_{\text{gas}} \cdot k_H$ (product of diffusivity and Henry’s law solubility). For hydrogen in Nafion, $D_{H2}$ might be on the order of 10⁻¹¹ to 10⁻¹⁰ m²/s with a solubility that increases with pressure. In modeling Faraday efficiency (Section 1), one may use a simple first-order permeation: $J_{H2,\text{xover}} = \frac{D_{H2,\text{mem}}}{t_{\text{mem}}}(C_{H2,\text{anode}} - C_{H2,\text{cath}})$ for diffusion-driven crossover ([Cathode Catalyst Layer Design in PEM Water Electrolysis toward Reduced Pt Loading and Hydrogen Crossover | ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.4c01827#:~:text=lowers%20the%20faradaic%20efficiency%20and,law%20by%20assuming%20an%20equilibrium)). Since cathode H₂ is usually near zero (fuel cell) or anode O₂ zero (electrolyzer), it simplifies to $J_{\text{xover}} \approx \frac{D,C_{\text{feed}}}{t_{\text{mem}}}$. This can be converted to a current loss ($i_{\text{xover}} = 2FJ_{H2,\text{xover}}$). For oxygen crossover (less discussed because hydrogen crossover is limiting safety factor), a similar term exists. Gas crossover rates increase with temperature and also if the membrane dries out (somewhat counterintuitively, dry membrane can allow more gas diffusion as polymer pores enlarge; however, very dry membrane also might crack or develop leaks). Including gas diffusivity in the model is essential for long-term efficiency calcs and open-circuit voltage predictions ([Introducing a Novel Technique for Measuring Hydrogen Crossover in Membrane-Based Electrochemical Cells](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774854#:~:text=diffuses%20to%20the%20anode,the%20most%20commonly%20used%20hydrogen)) (OCV drops when gases mix).
    
- **Water Permeability (Darcy’s Constant):** The membrane can transport water not only by diffusion and drag, but also by pressure-driven flow if liquid water is present. For PEM electrolyzers, a **hydraulic permeability** is defined (having units m², like Darcy’s law coefficient $K_{\text{mem}}$). It’s sometimes called **Darcy’s constant** for the membrane. If an electrolyzer anode is at higher pressure (liquid water feed) than the cathode, some water permeates and appears as vapor in the hydrogen stream. Experimental data can provide $K_{\text{mem}}$; for Nafion, values on the order of 10⁻¹⁸ to 10⁻¹⁷ m² have been reported ([[PDF] Impact of Water Properties on the Performance of PEM Electrolyzer](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202305.1511/v1/download#:~:text=Electrolyzer%20www,electrolyzer%20and%20further%20increase)) ([[PDF] Impact of Water Properties on the Performance of PEM Electrolyzer](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202305.1511/v1/download#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20TDS%20can%20cause%20fouling,electrolyzer%20and%20further%20increase)). In models, one might incorporate this as an additional term in the water flux equation (Eq. 13). If $\Delta p$ is significant (e.g. 1–2 bar across the membrane in a pressurized system), ignoring this term could under-predict hydrogen crossover and water content on the dry side.
    
- **Bruggeman’s Exponent in Membrane:** Although the membrane is a solid polymer electrolyte and not a porous medium in the conventional sense, the concept of Bruggeman’s correlation can apply to ionic pathways. Nafion has a phase-separated morphology with nano-channels of water. At lower hydration, these channels are disconnected or narrower, effectively increasing the tortuosity for proton conduction. Sometimes a **percolation model** is used: below a certain water content, conductivity drops rapidly. One can interpret this with a Bruggeman exponent for conductivity: $\sigma_{\text{mem}}(λ) \propto (λ - λ_{\text{percolation}})^b$ for $λ$ above a threshold. While not usually explicitly cited as “Bruggeman exponent” for membranes, the idea is analogous to how structure affects transport. In contrast, for gas crossover in membranes, if some fraction of membrane is liquid-filled vs gas-filled, a Bruggeman-like approach can mix the diffusivities. For example, if membrane pores are filled with water, hydrogen diffuses slower (since $D_{H2}$ in water is $10^{-9}$ m²/s vs $10^{-4}$ in air). Models of partially flooded membranes or catalyst layers sometimes use an exponent to account for how gas diffusion goes down with increasing liquid content ([Analytical-based simulation approach for an anion exchange membrane fuel cell](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84813.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%83%F0%9D%91%9F%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%91%93%20%290,effective%20exchange%20current%20densities%20for)). In summary, $b$ (Bruggeman exponent) is a fitting parameter to match how combined phases reduce effective transport in the membrane.
    
- **Electro-Osmotic Drag Coefficient:** This was introduced earlier; it is a membrane property often provided by the manufacturer or measured. For Nafion at 30 °C, $n_d≈2.5$ at full hydration, dropping to ~1 at low humidity ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Electro,7%5D%3A%20Nosmotic%20%3D%20nd)). Some advanced membranes have different $n_d$ characteristics (e.g. Aquivion, composite membranes). In the model, one uses either a constant $n_d$ or a function $n_d(λ)$ (as in Eq. 16) ([](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/30809/1/tesi.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Electro,7%5D%3A%20Nosmotic%20%3D%20nd)). This coefficient directly influences water distribution: higher $n_d$ means the membrane pulls more water to the cathode side (fuel cell) which can cause anode dry-out if back-diffusion isn’t sufficient.
    
- **Fouling and Degradation:** Over time, membranes can experience **fouling** (if contaminants from feed gases or water enter and get trapped) and chemical degradation (attack by radicals). Fouling might introduce a resistance to water or proton transport – for instance, cations (Na⁺, Ca²⁺) from impure water can occupy sulfonate sites, reducing proton conductivity and water content. This can be modeled as an additional **resistance** or a loss of active acid sites. One way to incorporate fouling is to gradually decrease $λ_{\text{max}}$ or $\kappa_{\text{mem}}$ over time, or add a fixed resistive term $R_{\text{foul}}$. For example, if calcium contamination leads to 10% of sulfonate sites being blocked, one might multiply conductivity by 0.9 to simulate it. Fouling also refers to possible precipitation of scales in porous components in liquid-fed systems ([[PDF] Impact of Water Properties on the Performance of PEM Electrolyzer](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202305.1511/v1/download#:~:text=Electrolyzer%20www,electrolyzer%20and%20further%20increase)) ([[PDF] Impact of Water Properties on the Performance of PEM Electrolyzer](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202305.1511/v1/download#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20TDS%20can%20cause%20fouling,electrolyzer%20and%20further%20increase)). In a PEM electrolyzer, minerals in water can deposit on the membrane or electrodes, effectively adding a diffusion barrier. In modeling, one could increase $R_{\text{ohm}}$ or decrease $K_{\text{mem}}$ to reflect that. While detailed fouling chemistry is beyond scope, its impact can be captured by adjusting model parameters and is often validated against long-term performance decline.
    
- **Voltage Loss and Shunt Currents:** In multi-cell stacks, **shunt currents** are unwanted leakage currents that bypass some cells and cause additional voltage losses. They typically occur when a conductive path exists outside the intended circuit – for example, in a PEM **electrolyzer stack** with a common water feed manifold, the water can conduct current from a high-voltage cell to a lower-voltage cell, effectively bypassing some of the load ([Shunt Currents in an Alkaline Electrolyzer Stack - COMSOL](https://www.comsol.com/model/shunt-currents-in-an-alkaline-electrolyzer-stack-113041#:~:text=Shunt%20Currents%20in%20an%20Alkaline,shunt%20currents%20flow%20between)) ([Shunt Currents in an Alkaline Electrolyzer Stack - COMSOL](https://www.comsol.com/model/shunt-currents-in-an-alkaline-electrolyzer-stack-113041#:~:text=In%20an%20alkaline%20electrolyzer%20stack%2C,shunt%20currents%20flow%20between)). Shunt currents do not pass through the membrane of each cell and thus do not generate hydrogen, hurting Faraday efficiency. They can be modeled by an equivalent circuit: e.g. a resistor representing the leakage path between points in the stack. The **shunt loss** is the voltage drop due to this current in the external circuit. If $I_{\text{shunt}}$ flows through a resistance outside the cell, that is a loss of current to the stack’s output. One can incorporate shunt effects by reducing the net current that actually goes through the cells: $I_{\text{net}} = I_{\text{draw}} - I_{\text{shunt}}$. Alternatively, an efficiency term can be included similar to Faraday efficiency. Empirical functions exist; for instance, shunt current often increases with the number of cells (higher total stack voltage) and the conductivity of the fluid path. A simple model might assume $I_{\text{shunt}} = \frac{V_{\text{stack}}}{R_{\text{leak}}}$, where $R_{\text{leak}}$ depends on water conductivity and geometry of the manifold. The **shunt voltage loss** then is $I_{\text{shunt}}\times R_{\text{ext}}$, but since $R_{\text{ext}}$ is just the circuit, more directly it just means less current is delivered. In terms of efficiency, one could write an effective $\eta_{\text{shunt}} = 1 - I_{\text{shunt}}/I_{\text{total}}$. In a well-designed PEMFC stack (with separate gas lines per cell), shunt currents are negligible, but in electrolyzers they can be a few percent of the current ([Faraday’s Efficiency Modeling of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer Based on Experimental Data](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4792#:~:text=been%20carried%20out%20on%20the,current%20and%20hydrogen%20pressure%20on)) ([Faraday’s Efficiency Modeling of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer Based on Experimental Data](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4792#:~:text=expression%20valid%20for%20the%20PEM,efficiency%20according%20to%20the%20operating)). Mitigation involves segmenting the manifold or adding resistive shims to increase the path resistance. In modeling a single cell, shunt currents are usually not included. But for completeness, if treating a module (which might imply a small stack), one can add a term in the efficiency calculation for shunt loss.
    

Finally, assembling all these sub-models yields a comprehensive PEM module model. In steady state, one can solve the algebraic equations: Nernst (open-circuit voltage), Butler–Volmer (current–overpotential), Ohm’s law (voltage drop), mass balance (to get concentrations or limiting current), and water balance (to get membrane hydration). These are often solved iteratively because of their coupling. For example, cell voltage $V_{\text{cell}}(i)$ can be solved by guessing _i_ and finding $\eta_{\text{act}}(i, c_{\text{O2}}(i))$, $\eta_{\text{conc}}(i,i_L(c_{\text{O2}}))$, etc., until the equation (5) is satisfied. Under transient conditions, the differential equations for species (7), temperature (15), and membrane water (16) are integrated in time (e.g. using an ODE solver or a CFD approach) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=2) ). High fidelity models use numerical methods (finite volume or finite element) to solve the coupled PDEs in 2D or 3D ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=The%20first%20application%20of%20CFD,13) ) ( [Three-Dimensional Transport Modeling for Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) Fuel Cell with Micro Parallel Flow Field - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663005/#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20we%20attempt,numerical%20simulation%20in%20this%20study) ). Such models have successfully predicted distributions of reactants, temperature, and water content in PEM cells, guiding design improvements. The equations and parameters outlined above, grounded in peer-reviewed formulations, form the basis for simulating and understanding PEM fuel cell and electrolyzer behavior across both steady-state and dynamic operating regimes.
