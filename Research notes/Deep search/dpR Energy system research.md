# Hybrid PV–Wind Hydrogen Production System in State College, PA

**Introduction:** This report examines a hybrid renewable energy system combining photovoltaic (PV) solar and wind power to drive a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer for hydrogen production in State College, Pennsylvania. We analyze 10 years of historical solar irradiance and wind data to understand resource variability and complementarity, and we develop models for the power output of 10 MW-scale PV arrays and wind turbines. Key performance metrics such as capacity factor and Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) are formulated. We also consider system configurations (standalone vs. grid-connected) and discuss how variable renewable power affects electrolyzer efficiency, utilization, and hydrogen output. Relevant equations, assumptions, and parameter definitions are provided throughout, with cited sources and illustrative figures and tables.

## 1. Solar and Wind Resource Variability (State College, PA)

**Solar Resource:** State College has a moderate solar resource, with annual average global horizontal irradiance on the order of 3.5–4.5 kWh/m²/day (roughly 1280–1640 kWh/m²/year) on a horizontal surface. This is about 60–65% of the solar radiation levels in the U.S. desert Southwest​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_Pennsylvania#:~:text=capacity%20has%20a%20societal%20benefit,as%20the%20southwest%20United%20States)​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_Pennsylvania#:~:text=frequently%20have%20low%20capacity%20factors,as%20the%20southwest%20United%20States), reflecting Pennsylvania’s more frequent cloud cover and higher latitude. Solar irradiance exhibits strong **seasonal and diurnal variability**: long summer days with higher sun angles yield far more solar energy than short, overcast winter days. For example, the average peak solar irradiance at noon in July can exceed 700 W/m², whereas in December it may only reach ~250 W/m² at noon (see **Figure 1**). This translates to a typical summer day producing ~5–6 kWh/m², versus ~2 kWh/m² on a winter day. The daily profile is also highly concentrated in midday hours (roughly 9 AM–4 PM local time for significant generation). **Figure 1** illustrates the average diurnal irradiance in July (high, broad midday peak) vs. December (much lower peak and shorter duration).

_Figure 1: Average hourly global horizontal irradiance in State College, PA for July (top) vs. December (bottom). Summer days receive higher and longer solar irradiance, while winter days are shorter and cloudier, drastically reducing solar input​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc470/node/546#:~:text=Image%3A%20Average%20iradiance%20level%20by,PA%20in%20December%20and%20July)​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc470/node/546#:~:text=that%20this%20is%20the%20average,this%20solar%20energy%20into%20electricity)._

Over a 10-year period, year-to-year solar output can vary due to weather patterns, but annual totals are relatively stable (within ±10% typically). Cloudiness and snow cover (which can temporarily reduce PV output if panels are covered) are significant factors in Pennsylvania. Overall, Pennsylvania’s solar resource, while lower than sunnier states, is sufficient for utility-scale PV – indeed, an annual average of >3.5 kWh/m²/day is generally considered viable for PV projects​[rural.pa.gov](https://www.rural.pa.gov/download.cfm?file=Resources/reports/assets/263/Baseline%20Assessment%20of%20Solar%20Power%20in%20Rural%20Pennsylvania%20Report%20Web.pdf#:~:text=,5%20kWh%2Fm2%2Fday)​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/52615.pdf#:~:text=To%20be%20economically%20viable%2C%20PV,utility%20incentives%20or%20insufficient) (many U.S. sites exceed this threshold).

**Wind Resource:** The wind resource in State College is complementary to solar in some respects. Centre County’s surface wind speeds average about 8 mph (~3.6 m/s) at 10 m height​[centrecountypa.gov](https://centrecountypa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/355#:~:text=Winds%20The%20average%20velocity%20of,5)​[centrecountypa.gov](https://centrecountypa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/355#:~:text=The%20average%20velocity%20of%20surface,are%20few%20trees%2C%20the%20wind). At the hub height of modern wind turbines (80–100 m or more), wind speeds are higher; Pennsylvania’s ridges and open areas can see mean wind speeds on the order of 6–7 m/s at 100 m in good sites (class 3 wind resource)​[rural.pa.gov](https://www.rural.pa.gov/download.cfm?file=Resources/reports/assets/263/Baseline%20Assessment%20of%20Solar%20Power%20in%20Rural%20Pennsylvania%20Report%20Web.pdf#:~:text=,5%20kWh%2Fm2%2Fday). Wind is characterized by significant **temporal variability**: it varies with weather fronts, and tends to be higher at nighttime and in winter months in this region. For example, winter cold fronts can bring strong winds (and no solar), whereas summer has more calm high-pressure days (but strong solar). Over 10 years, wind data would show a wide range of hourly speeds (from near 0 m/s in calm conditions up to 20+ m/s in storms). The **capacity factor** of wind in Pennsylvania is relatively modest – older projects averaged ~30%​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649#:~:text=The%20average%20capacity%20factor%20of,sited%20wind%20farms), but newer turbine designs and taller towers can achieve 35–40% in good locations​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649#:~:text=The%20average%20capacity%20factor%20of,sited%20wind%20farms). Pennsylvania’s onshore wind resource is sufficient for substantial energy: NREL estimates PA’s wind could supply ~6% of current electricity needs even with existing technology​[gba.org](https://www.gba.org/resources/green-building-methods/energy-solutions/wind-power/#:~:text=Wind%20Power%20,for%20more%20information%20on). Notably, wind often blows at times when solar is weak (night or winter), indicating a potential **complementarity** between the two resources (explored further in Section 5).

**Data Sources:** The historical solar and wind data for State College can be obtained from sources like the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) for irradiance and NASA’s POWER or NREL’s Wind Integration National Dataset for wind speeds. Local measurements (e.g. Penn State’s meteorological observatory) also provide long-term hourly records. For analysis, hourly time-series of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and wind speed at hub height over 2015–2024 would be used to compute the available PV and wind power, respectively. Key statistical outputs from the data would include the mean and standard deviation of hourly values, seasonal averages, and the incidence of extremes (e.g. number of hours of zero output vs. full output). This data-driven approach informs the design of the hybrid system by quantifying how often and how strongly each resource is available.

## 2. Photovoltaic (PV) Power Output Modeling

**PV Power Equation:** The power output of a PV array is primarily a function of solar irradiance, the array size, conversion efficiency, and temperature. A standard modeling equation for a PV system’s AC power is:
$P_{PV} = P_{STC} \times \frac{G}{G_{STC}} \times [1 + \alpha_p (T_{cell} - T_{STC})] \times f_{PV},$

where:

-  $P_{\text{STC}}$ ​ is the rated DC power of the PV array at Standard Test Conditions (STC) (irradiance $G_{\text{STC}}=1000$ W/m², cell temperature $T_{\text{STC}}=25^\circ$C). For a 10 MW_ac system, the DC STC capacity might be higher (e.g. ~12–13 MW_dc if an inverter loading ratio >1 is used).
    
- $G$ is the actual solar irradiance on the PV plane (W/m²). For fixed flat panels, this is typically the global horizontal or a tilt-adjusted irradiance; for simplicity we can use horizontal GHI for broad analysis, or plane-of-array irradiance for more accuracy.
    
- $\alpha_p$ is the temperature coefficient of power (per °C), typically around –0.4%/°C for silicon panels. This term [1+αp(Tcell−25∘C)][1+\alpha_p (T_{\text{cell}}-25^\circ\text{C})][1+αp​(Tcell​−25∘C)] accounts for the decrease in panel efficiency at higher cell temperatures (negative $\alpha_p$ means higher temperature reduces output).
    
- $T_{\text{cell}}$ is the PV cell operating temperature (°C). It depends on ambient temperature and irradiance; a common approximation is $T_{\text{cell}} = T_{\text{amb}} + \frac{NOCT-20^\circ\text{C}}{800} \times G$, where NOCT is the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (often ~45°C) at 800 W/m² and 20°C ambient. High irradiance and warm ambient lead to elevated cell temperatures, which reduce output.
    
- $f_{\text{pv}}$ is an overall derating or performance factor (dimensionless, ≤1) accounting for system losses: inverter efficiency, wiring losses, soiling (dust), module degradation, mismatch, etc. A typical overall DC-to-AC derate might be around 0.75–0.85 (75–85%). For instance, dust and wiring losses combined might reduce output by a few percent, inverter inefficiencies by ~2–5%, and so on​[extension.arizona.edu](https://extension.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2024-08/az1782-2019.pdf#:~:text=Derate%20Factors%20Each%20system%20has,specific%20derate%20factors%20include%3A%20inverter)​[extension.arizona.edu](https://extension.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2024-08/az1782-2019.pdf#:~:text=factors,temperature%20losses%2C%20and%20inverter%20efficiencies). In one example, multiplying various loss factors (module quality, wiring, inverter, etc.) yielded an overall derate of ~0.722 (72.2%)​[extension.arizona.edu](https://extension.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2024-08/az1782-2019.pdf#:~:text=factors,temperature%20losses%2C%20and%20inverter%20efficiencies).
    

In words, the PV output scales with irradiance (linear proportionality), adjusted for real-world losses and temperature effects. At full sun ($G=1000$ W/m²) and 25°C cell temp, a well-designed 10 MW_ac PV array would produce ~10 MW (after AC conversion). In cold, very sunny conditions, output can exceed nominal (panels are more efficient in cold). Conversely, on a hot summer afternoon when cell temps might reach 60°C, the output could be perhaps 80–90% of the ideal due to the negative temperature coefficient.

**Parameters and Assumptions:** In modeling, one would assume values like $\alpha_p \approx -0.0045/°C$ (–0.45% per °C for silicon PV), $f_{\text{pv}}$ around 0.8 (including a typical inverter efficiency ~98% and other losses). $T_{\text{cell}}$ can be estimated from ambient temperature data; e.g. on a 30°C day with full sun, $T_{\text{cell}}$ might be ~55°C, leading to a factor $[1+\alpha_p(T_{\text{cell}}-25)] \approx 1 - 0.0045\times30 \approx 0.865$ (i.e. ~13.5% power loss from temperature). We assume modules are fixed tilt at latitude angle or use single-axis tracking for 10 MW system – tracking adds ~10–20% energy yield annually by following the sun​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/solar-pv-energy-factsheet#:~:text=production%20up%20to%2015,16%7DIn%202022), at the cost of slightly higher $f_{\text{pv}}$ losses (due to tracker power and maintenance).

**Output Profile:** Using the solar data, we can compute the PV power each hour. PV output is zero at night, ramps up after sunrise, peaks at solar noon, and zeros out at sunset. In State College, a clear summer day would see near full power at noon (10 MW), whereas a cloudy winter day might only see a few hundred kW if any. The **capacity factor** of a PV plant in PA (ratio of actual energy to the energy if it ran at full power 24/7) is on the order of 15–20%. For example, a 10 MW_ac fixed-tilt array might produce about 15,000–17,000 MWh/year, corresponding to ~17% CF. This relatively low CF (compared to fossil or nuclear plants) is due to the limited sun hours and weather dependency​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_Pennsylvania#:~:text=capacity%20has%20a%20societal%20benefit,as%20the%20southwest%20United%20States)​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_Pennsylvania#:~:text=frequently%20have%20low%20capacity%20factors,as%20the%20southwest%20United%20States).

Despite the variability, PV offers very **predictable** availability in the sense that daylight hours are known and seasonal patterns are consistent year to year (peak in summer, low in winter). Short-term fluctuations (cloud passage) can be rapid (output dropping or rising tens of percent in minutes), which could impact electrolyzer operation if not buffered.


## 3. Wind Turbine Power Output Modeling

**Wind Power Characteristics:** Wind turbine power output is a non-linear function of wind speed. Each turbine has a **power curve** relating instantaneous wind speed to power output. A typical utility-scale wind turbine (e.g. 2–3 MW onshore unit) has these key parameters: cut-in speed ~3–4 m/s (below this, no power), a rated wind speed ~12–14 m/s (at which it produces its rated power), and a cut-out speed ~20–25 m/s (above which it shuts down for safety)​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649#:~:text=As%20you%20can%20see%2C%20even,is%20higher%20than%2025%20m%2Fs). Between cut-in and rated speed, power increases roughly with the cube of wind speed (following the physics of kinetic energy in wind), until the max power is reached. Formally, in the idealized region below rated:


$$P_{\text{wind}} = \tfrac{1}{2} \rho A C_p v^3$$

where:

- $\rho$ is air density (about 1.225 kg/m³ at sea level, slightly lower at State College’s elevation ~350 m, and varies with temperature/pressure),
    
- $A = \pi R^2$ is the swept area of the turbine rotor (for a 100 m diameter turbine, $A\approx7850$ m²),
    
- $C_p$ is the power coefficient (efficiency of converting wind’s kinetic energy to mechanical power), theoretically limited to 59.3% (Betz limit). Real turbines achieve $C_p \approx 0.45$ at the optimal operating point​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=residential%20applications%20to%20100m%2B%20in,generator%20from%20what%20it%20could)​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=,generator%20from%20what%20it%20could) (around 75% of Betz limit at peak efficiency).
    
- $v$ is the wind speed (m/s) at hub height.
    

In practice, manufacturers provide the empirical power curve. For example, consider a 95 kW turbine (small scale) power curve: at 5 m/s it produced ~15 kW, at 8 m/s ~59 kW, and at 12 m/s ~90 kW (nearly rated); above ~15 m/s it actually slightly declined and held ~95 kW until cut-out at 25 m/s​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649#:~:text=Wind%20Speed%20and%20Corresponding%20Power,7)​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649#:~:text=As%20you%20can%20see%2C%20even,is%20higher%20than%2025%20m%2Fs). Utility turbines follow the same S-shaped pattern: zero below cut-in, steep ramp-up in mid speeds, plateau at rated power.

**10 MW Wind Farm:** To have ~10 MW of wind capacity, one could use multiple turbines (e.g. five 2 MW turbines, or three 3.3 MW turbines). The total output of the wind farm is the sum of each turbine’s output. Assuming identical exposure, we can scale a single turbine’s power curve to multiple units.

We implement the power curve against the historical wind data hour by hour. Notably, wind speeds vary stochastically: there will be hours of zero output (calm winds) and hours of full output (strong winds) and everything in between. Unlike solar, wind can blow any time of day, so the distribution of wind power is often complementary: nights and winter can have significant wind generation. In Pennsylvania, wind speeds are generally higher in winter (due to more storms and larger air density) – thus wind power tends to produce relatively more in seasons when solar is weaker, a beneficial complementarity.

**Capacity Factor and Variability:** The capacity factor of the wind farm is computed similarly: total annual wind energy / (10 MW * 8760). If the average wind speed at hub height is, say, 6 m/s, a rough estimate might yield a CF around 25–30%. Modern projects in the U.S. average ~37% CF onshore​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=through%20the%20rotor%20area.%5E%7B11%7D%20,land%2C%20and%20capacity%20factors%20are), with a wide range depending on site quality (9% in poor sites up to 50%+ in the windiest sites)​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=,down%20from%20a)​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=through%20the%20rotor%20area.%5E%7B11%7D%20,7%2C14). For Pennsylvania, 25–35% is a reasonable range. Over 10 years of data, one would integrate the hourly wind power to find the mean CF. The **variability** is significant: wind output can change on timescales of minutes (gusts or lulls) to hours (fronts moving through). However, turbines have inertia and control systems to smooth very short fluctuations somewhat.

We assume for modeling that the wind farm’s availability is high (modern turbines have ~98% mechanical availability). Some losses (array losses, maintenance downtime) might be a few percent – analogous to PV’s derate factor, wind farms also experience losses (e.g. turbulence between turbines, electrical losses). These can be included in a derate factor $f_{\text{wind}}$ ~0.9–0.95 perhaps. For simplicity, we incorporate major effects into the power curve directly.

**Example Calculation:** If State College’s 10-year average wind at 100 m was 6 m/s, using a representative turbine (with cut-in ~3 m/s, rated 3 MW at 12 m/s), one might find ~8–9 GWh/year per 3 MW turbine. Three such turbines (9 MW) would then produce ~27 GWh/year, giving CF ≈ 34%. In calmer years it might be lower. This level of detail would come from actual hourly computation using the data.


## 4. Capacity Factors of PV, Wind, and Hybrid System

**Individual Capacity Factor:** As defined above, the _capacity factor (CF)_ is the ratio of actual energy output over a period to the energy output if the plant ran at full nameplate capacity the entire time​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649#:~:text=One%20last%20consideration%20to%20make,is%20available%20throughout%20the%20year)​[e-education.psu.edu](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649#:~:text=The%20formula%20is%20capacity%20factor,actual%20output%2Fmaximum%20possible%20output). Mathematically, over a year:

$\mathrm{CF} = \frac{\text{Actual MWh in year}}{P_{\text{nameplate}} \times 8760 \text{ hours}}.$

For a 10 MW PV array in State College, we estimated CF $\approx 15–18\%$. For a 10 MW (aggregate) wind installation, CF $\approx 25–35\%$. These figures encapsulate the resource availability: solar is limited by day length and weather, wind by the wind speed distribution relative to turbine power curve.

**Hybrid System Capacity Factor:** For a **hybrid PV–wind system feeding a 10 MW electrolyzer, a relevant metric is the **combined capacity factor with respect to the electrolyzer load**. The electrolyzer has its own capacity (10 MW consumption corresponds to a hydrogen production rate, as discussed later). If the PV and wind are both sized at 10 MW, the _combined generation capacity_ is 20 MW. If both ran at full power simultaneously, there would be excess power beyond what a 10 MW electrolyzer can consume (unless surplus is stored or fed to grid). In a standalone (off-grid) scenario, any excess would be curtailed. To quantify utilization, we define an **electrolyzer capacity factor**:


$\mathrm{CF}_{\text{electrolyzer}} = \frac{\text{Hydrogen energy output (or equivalent elec. used) per year}}{P_{\text{electrolyzer}} \times 8760}.$

This is effectively the percentage of time (on average) the electrolyzer runs at full power (or, equivalently, the fraction of its maximum possible hydrogen output that is actually achieved). A key design goal is to maximize this, since a low electrolyzer CF means under-utilized (stranded) electrolyzer capacity.

If PV and wind were **independent** and not co-located, their outputs could simply add. But in a hybrid, especially off-grid, one might not size both at 1:1 to electrolyzer. Two common strategies: **(a)** Size PV + wind such that their _sum_ rarely exceeds the electrolyzer capacity (to minimize curtailment), or **(b)** Oversize the renewables relative to electrolyzer to maximize hydrogen production (accepting some curtailment when both resources are high). For analysis, one might consider an oversizing factor. For example, if both PV and wind are 10 MW, the peak combined is 20 MW, meaning up to 10 MW could be wasted at times of simultaneous peak. However, those times might be infrequent because solar and wind peaks don’t always coincide. **Complementarity** comes into play: often when solar is at max (clear noon), wind might be lower (midday tends to have lower wind than afternoon/evening due to typical land breeze patterns). Conversely, at night wind might be available when solar is zero, allowing the electrolyzer to run on wind alone.

To calculate the hybrid capacity factor properly, one would sum the PV and wind power hour-by-hour, cap that sum at the electrolyzer’s maximum intake (if standalone), and then integrate over the year. The ratio of that integrated used power to the electrolyzer capacity * 8760 gives the CF. If grid-connected, the electrolyzer CF could be kept at 100% by supplementing any shortfall with grid power – but then the system isn’t purely renewable. In a fully renewable standalone case, the CF will be <100% because there will be times with insufficient renewable power to run at full 10 MW.

**Expected Hybrid CF:** Thanks to PV-wind complementarity, the hybrid might significantly exceed either resource’s individual CF for supplying the electrolyzer. For instance, if solar CF ~17% and wind ~30% individually, the combined might allow the electrolyzer to achieve perhaps 50–60% utilization. This is because wind can contribute in off-solar hours. In an ideal perfectly complementary scenario (solar by day, wind by night, each providing full 10 MW at different times), the electrolyzer could run almost 24 hours (CF ~100%). In reality, there will still be gaps (e.g. overcast, calm days where neither produces much, and some overlap where both produce more than needed). A rough calculation: PV contributes mostly in ~12 hours of daylight, wind might contribute throughout day but more at night; we might find the electrolyzer running at some level, say, 70% of the time. If the electrolyzer is allowed to modulate, it might often run at partial load (which still counts toward CF in terms of average power).

Without doing a full simulation here, we note this approach is how to get the “hybrid capacity factor.” It’s essentially the capacity factor of the combined generation **constrained by** the electrolyzer’s intake capacity. Techniques like **loss of load probability** or **fractional utilization** can also be used to size systems: e.g., determine how often the electrolyzer would be starved of power or how often excess occurs.

**Example:** Suppose over a year, PV produces 15 GWh and wind 26 GWh (as earlier estimates). Sum = 41 GWh. If there were no losses, that’s equivalent to an average of 4.68 MW. For a 10 MW electrolyzer, that’s a 46.8% utilization if all energy could be used. However, if a portion of that energy comes at overlapping times exceeding 10 MW, some is lost. If complementarity is good, the lost fraction might be small. Let’s assume 10% of wind energy comes when solar is also at max (just a guess); then maybe ~38 GWh can be utilized. That gives ~4.34 MW average on electrolyzer, or CF ~43%. This is speculative – actual data correlation analysis is needed for precision.

## . Complementarity of PV and Wind Profiles

One advantage of a hybrid PV–wind system is that solar and wind resources tend to **complement each other** to some degree, smoothing the power supply. **Complementarity** can be quantified through statistical metrics:

- **Correlation Coefficient:** A simple measure is the correlation between solar and wind power time series (daily or hourly). If the correlation is negative or low, it means when one is high, the other is often low – a sign of complementarity. Studies often find that wind and PV output are weakly negatively correlated on daily timescales in many regions​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=metrics%E2%80%94the%20Pearson%20correlation%20coefficient%20and,daily%20complementarity%20of%20VRE%20resource). For example, in the U.S. Northeast (which includes PA), wind and solar are found to be moderately to strongly complementary in timing​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=many%20regions%20of%20the%20United,complementary%20in%20the%20Central%20Valley)​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=20%20megawatts%29,In). This means high solar production periods tend to coincide with lower wind, and vice versa, more often than pure chance, spreading the combined generation more evenly​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=temporal%20complementarity%20of%20pairs%20of,cost%20synergies%20due%20to%20smaller)​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=Through%20the%20evaluation%20of%20two,both%20in%20terms%20of%20the).
    
- **Stability Coefficient / Combined Variability:** Another approach is to look at the variability of the _sum_ compared to each alone. If PV and wind are perfectly complementary (out of phase), the combined output will have a higher **combined capacity factor** and lower variance than the individual sources. NREL’s analysis introduced a “stability coefficient” metric to capture how steady the combined output is relative to individual outputs​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=metrics%20are%20rooted%20in%20distinct,not%20capture%20the%20potential%20for)​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=New%20England,indicator%20of%20economic%20value%2C%20and). A high stability (and low correlation) indicates good complementarity.
    

For State College, **qualitative complementarity** is expected: solar is zero at night, but that’s often when winds pick up (no solar at night, so wind can fill in). Seasonally, winter has poor solar but is the windiest season; summer has great solar but often lighter winds. Indeed, a mix of wind and PV can provide a more year-round steady supply of energy​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=many%20regions%20of%20the%20United,complementary%20in%20the%20Central%20Valley). An analysis over the past 10 years might show, for instance, that on the majority of days where solar output is below average (cloudy days), wind output is above average (due to weather systems bringing clouds and wind together), and during high solar periods (clear hot days), wind is often low (high-pressure systems cause clear skies but calm winds). This inverse relationship, while not perfect, reduces the fraction of time when **both** resources are simultaneously low. That is critical for off-grid hydrogen production because if both PV and wind are near zero (e.g. a clear but still night – which is rare because clear night often calm, but then next day solar returns; or a dark stormy day – but storms usually have wind), hydrogen production would stop or draw on backups.

To **quantify complementarity**, one could calculate the Pearson correlation of daily capacity factors: likely slightly negative. Alternatively, count the hours of “low total output” vs. “low individual output.” For example, perhaps PV alone is zero ~50% of the time (night), wind alone is low (<20% of max) 30% of time, but the combined system has near-zero output only, say, 10% of the time (times when it’s both night _and_ unusually calm). We might also define a **complementarity index** such as:

$\mathrm{CI} = \frac{\sigma_P^2 + \sigma_W^2 - \sigma_{P+W}^2}{\sigma_P^2 + \sigma_W^2},$

where $\sigma$ are variances of PV, wind, and combined outputs. If PV and wind output fluctuations cancel each other out, $\sigma_{P+W}$ will be much smaller than $\sigma_P$ and $\sigma_W$, giving a high $CI$. A more straightforward indicator is just how much higher the hybrid CF is compared to a weighted average of individual CFs.

According to recent research, **solar PV combined with wind** consistently shows one of the strongest complementary effects among renewables​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=many%20regions%20of%20the%20United,complementary%20in%20the%20Central%20Valley)​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=20%20megawatts%29,In%20the%20Southeast). In practical terms, this means the hybrid plant can achieve a higher effective capacity factor and require less storage or grid buffering to provide a steadier power output for the electrolyzer. For the design, this suggests that co-locating wind and PV (and sharing power electronics or electrolyzer capacity) can yield synergies: the electrolyzer and interconnection can be smaller than the sum of two separate systems, yet capture most of the energy (this is the idea behind “flexible complementary hybrids” noted in literature​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=across%20time%2C%20resulting%20in%20reduced,can%20reduce%20the%20variability%20in)​[nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/81901.pdf#:~:text=many%20regions%20of%20the%20United,complementary%20in%20the%20Central%20Valley)).

In summary, complementarity in State College should allow significantly more continuous hydrogen production than either PV or wind alone. We expect relatively few periods where both PV and wind are simultaneously producing at very low levels (perhaps prolonged high-pressure winter inversions could suppress both sun (clouds) and wind – but usually wind still blows in cloudy weather). Conversely, periods of both at maximum might lead to curtailment if no buffering, but these might be managed (for instance, windy afternoons in spring could see full wind and some sun). Proper quantification would use the 10-year hourly data to compute metrics like correlation (likely $r\approx -0.2$ to $-0.4$ daily) and the improvement in combined output stability.


## 6. Capital Cost Estimates (10 MW Scale Systems)

When designing a 10 MW-scale hybrid plant, understanding capital costs is crucial. Below we summarize typical **capital expenditure (CAPEX)** ranges for utility-scale PV, wind, and PEM electrolyzers around 2025, focusing on ~10 MW class projects:

- **Utility-Scale PV Farm (10 MW_ac):** PV costs are usually given per watt (W) of AC capacity. Recent data (despite some inflation in supply chains) show utility PV installation costs around **$1.3 /W_ac** in 2022​[emp.lbl.gov](https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/emp-files/utility_scale_solar_2023_edition_slides.pdf#:~:text=Despite%20inflationary%20pressures%2C%20utility,percentile%20of%20project%20costs%20fell), down from $1.5/W a year earlier. This translates to ~$1,300 per kW. For 10 MW, roughly **$10–15 million** total installed cost is expected. This includes modules, inverters, racking, wiring, site prep, and labor. It can vary by region and specific technology: fixed-tilt systems might be slightly cheaper than tracking (which adds mechanical cost). The **range** could be $1.1–1.4/W (i.e. $11–14M for 10 MW) in the current market. These costs have fallen dramatically over the past decade (PV module prices dropped, efficiencies rose), but recently flattened or ticked up due to commodity prices. Still, solar is one of the cheapest sources of new power. _(Note: residential/commercial PV costs are higher, but for utility scale we use economies of scale.)_
    
- **Wind Turbines (10 MW aggregate):** Onshore wind also has seen cost reductions historically. The capacity-weighted average installed cost in the U.S. is about **$1,300–$1,400 per kW** as of the early 2020s​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=%2A%20On%20a%20capacity,since%202012.%5E%7B7). One source notes costs around $1,370/kW in 2022 on average​[css.umich.edu](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=%2A%20On%20a%20capacity,since%202012.%5E%7B7), after a plateau in the mid-2010s. Thus a 10 MW wind farm might cost on the order of **$13–$15 million**. This includes turbine procurement (blades, nacelle, tower), transportation, construction (cranes, foundation), grid interconnection, etc. There is some economy of scale with larger projects, but even a few turbines will approach that average. We assume modern 2–4 MW turbines; their individual cost might be ~$3–4M each. It’s worth noting wind cost can vary with site (terrain, road access, etc.). The cited range of recent pricing is about $900–$1,200/kW for new projects​[energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/land-based-wind-market-report-2023-edition.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Land,from%20a%20range%20of), with U.S. projects averaging ~$1,100/kW in the last few years when factoring large installations. To be conservative for a smaller 10 MW project, we stick to ~$1.3k/kW. Wind also has O&M costs (discussed later) but here we focus on CAPEX.
    
- **PEM Electrolyzer (10 MW hydrogen plant):** Electrolyzer costs are usually quoted per kW of hydrogen production capacity. PEM electrolyzers have historically been expensive, but costs are coming down with manufacturing scale and technology. In Western markets around 2021–2024, turnkey PEM electrolyzer systems cost roughly **$1,400 per kW** (i.e. $1.4M per MW) on average​[pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/21/electrolyzer-prices-what-to-expect/#:~:text=Wang%20said%20that%20the%20project,PEM%29%20electrolyzers)​[pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/21/electrolyzer-prices-what-to-expect/#:~:text=electrolyzers%20are%20around%20four%20times,PEM%29%20electrolyzers). For 10 MW, that implies about **$14 million**. This figure corresponds to about €1,200/kW for alkaline and €1,400/kW for PEM in recent industry reports​[pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/21/electrolyzer-prices-what-to-expect/#:~:text=Wang%20said%20that%20the%20project,PEM%29%20electrolyzers). These include not just the stack, but power electronics, gas conditioning, and balance-of-plant. We note that in regions like China, costs are significantly lower – e.g. a quote of $300/kW (for alkaline) has been reported​[pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/21/electrolyzer-prices-what-to-expect/#:~:text=MW%20that%20deliver%20hydrogen%20at,development%2C%20approvals%20and%20financing%20agreements)​[pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/21/electrolyzer-prices-what-to-expect/#:~:text=Wang%20said%20that%20the%20project,PEM%29%20electrolyzers), but that excluded many project-level costs. For our purposes, Western electrolyzer costs in the range $1,000–$1,500/kW are appropriate. By 2030, DOE targets aim for <$500/kW for electrolyzers as manufacturing scales, which would drastically cut hydrogen costs. But current real-world projects still see roughly $1–1.5k/kW. It’s also important to consider installation and commissioning costs – often electrolyzer systems are modular (e.g. a 10 MW plant might consist of several 2–5 MW modules in containers).


**Summary of CAPEX (approximate 2025 values):**

| Component               | Capacity               | Unit CAPEX                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Total Cost (est.) |

| Wind Turbines (onshore) | 10 MW                  | $1.1–1.4 per W                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ~$13–14 million   |
| PEM Electrolyzer Plant  | 10 MW_h2 (consumption) | ~$1.4k per kW_h2​[pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/21/electrolyzer-prices-what-to-expect/#:~:text=Wang%20said%20that%20the%20project,PEM%29%20electrolyzers)                                                | ~$14–15 million   |

_(Here “10 MW_h2” refers to an electrolyzer consuming 10 MW of electricity at full load; its hydrogen output in kg/hr depends on efficiency – roughly 200 kg H₂ per hour at 10 MW for ~50 kWh/kg as detailed in Section 8.)_


These capital costs set the stage for economic analysis. Note that if the system is grid-connected, there may also be costs for **grid interconnection, transformers, etc.**, which can be significant (several hundred $k to millions depending on substation requirements). If standalone, one might invest in **battery storage** for buffer, which has its own cost (currently ~$300/kWh installed). We exclude storage in this initial analysis but note it as an option.

Also, **Operational costs** (OPEX) will matter for LCOH: PV O&M is low ($15/kW/yr), wind O&M higher ($30/kW/yr) plus maintenance, and electrolyzer O&M includes stack replacements over its life (stacks may need replacement every 5–10 years). These factors will be brought into the LCOH calculation next.


## 7. Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) Calculation

To evaluate economic viability, we calculate the **Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH)** – the cost per unit of hydrogen (typically per kilogram) produced, taking into account all capital and operating expenses over the project life. It’s analogous to a levelized cost of energy but for hydrogen output.

**LCOH Formula:** In general form, the LCOH can be expressed as​[observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu](https://observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/Manual%20-%20Levelised%20Cost%20of%20Hydrogen%20%28LCOH%29%20Calculator.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%91%BB%F0%9D%92%90%F0%9D%92%95%F0%9D%92%82%F0%9D%92%8D%20%F0%9D%91%B3%F0%9D%91%AA%F0%9D%91%B6%F0%9D%91%AF%20,LCOH%29%20in%20EUR%2Fkg):

$\mathrm{LCOH} = \frac{\text{Annualized CAPEX} + \text{Annual OPEX}}{\text{Annual hydrogen output (kg)}}.$


Breaking this down:

- _Annualized CAPEX_: We convert the upfront capital cost into an equivalent annual cost using a capital recovery factor (CRF). For example, if total CAPEX (electrolyzer + allocated renewable cost) is $C$ and the project life is $N$ years with discount rate $r$, the annualized CAPEX = $C \times \text{CRF}$, where $\text{CRF} = \frac{r(1+r)^N}{(1+r)^N - 1}$. A typical assumption might be $N=20$ years, $r=6\%$ for such a project​[observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu](https://observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/Manual%20-%20Levelised%20Cost%20of%20Hydrogen%20%28LCOH%29%20Calculator.pdf#:~:text=%28Equation%202%29,to%20derive%20the%20total%20energy) (electrolyzer stacks might be replaced sooner, but we can incorporate replacement in OPEX or adjust life).
    
- _Annual OPEX_: This includes fixed O&M (maintenance, labor, insurance) for the PV, wind, and electrolyzer, plus variable costs like water for electrolysis and any **electricity purchase costs** if grid power is used. In a fully renewable setup, we might not purchase electricity, but if grid is a backup, any kWh bought from grid at cost would count here. Also include electrolyzer stack replacement as an OPEX or periodic CAPEX (some methodologies treat major component replacement as a capital cost spread over time).
    
- _Annual H₂ output_: This is the kilograms of hydrogen produced per year. It depends on how often the electrolyzer runs and at what power, and the efficiency (kWh per kg). We compute it from the energy input from renewables that goes into the electrolyzer. For instance, if our electrolyzer has a utilization (capacity factor) of 50% at 10 MW, that’s 43,800 MWh/year input. If the electrolyzer efficiency is, say, 65% (HHV basis), meaning ~52.5 kWh electricity per kg H₂ (since 1 kg H₂ has ~39.4 kWh of energy content HHV), then 43,800 MWh would produce about $43,800,000 \text{ kWh} / 52.5 \text{ kWh/kg} \approx 834,000$ kg H₂ per year.
    

We must be careful with efficiency definitions (HHV vs LHV). Often LCOH is calculated on a lower heating value basis for hydrogen. But we will use numbers consistently.

**Including All Components:** If the PV and wind are dedicated solely to hydrogen (off-grid), then their costs should be included in the numerator and we do not include an electricity purchase cost (since the renewables are the source). In that case: 
$\text{Annualized CAPEX} = C_{\text{PV}} \times \text{CRF} + C_{\text{wind}} \times \text{CRF} + C_{\text{electrolyzer}} \times \text{CRF},$
, summing the contributions of each capital component. If grid-connected, one might instead treat PV/wind as supplying electricity at their own levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and possibly buying any shortfall. An alternative formulation is:  ,
$\text{LCOH} = \frac{\sum_i C_{i} \times \text{CRF} + \text{Annual O\&M}_i + P_{\text{grid}} \times E_{\text{grid}}}{m_{H2}}$ 
where $P_{\text{grid}}$ is grid electricity price and $E_{\text{grid}}$ any electricity taken from grid, and $C_i$ includes all components. The formula given by the Clean Hydrogen Observatory similarly includes terms for electricity cost, grid fees, etc., added to the CAPEX component​[observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu](https://observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/Manual%20-%20Levelised%20Cost%20of%20Hydrogen%20%28LCOH%29%20Calculator.pdf#:~:text=expenses%20include%20electricity%20costs%20for,from%20subsidies%20and%20oxygen%20sales).

**Key Assumptions for LCOH:**

- **Project life:** assume 20 years for PV/wind, and electrolyzer stack replacements every ~7–10 years. We can incorporate stack replacement by either shortening effective electrolyzer life or adding a periodic cost. For simplicity, maybe assume a single mid-life stack replacement funded by a reserve (which effectively increases the annual O&M or CAPEX).
- **Discount rate:** assume 6–8% (could be lower if subsidized).
- **Capacity factor/utilization:** as derived from the hybrid analysis, maybe 40–50% for electrolyzer (if off-grid). If grid supplement is allowed, electrolyzer could be 100%, but then we have to buy electricity for the gaps (which adds to cost).
- **Efficiency:** assume electrolyzer uses 50 kWh electricity per kg H₂ (which is ~78% HHV efficiency, realistic for PEM​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=match%20at%20L451%20PEM%20electrolysis,maintaining%20durability%20as%20progress%20in)​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=PEM%20electrolysis%20has%20an%20electrical,maintaining%20durability%20as%20progress%20in)). We will use this to compute hydrogen output from energy.
- **O&M costs:** PV ~ $15/kW-year (so $150k/yr for 10 MW), wind $30/kW-year (so $300k/yr for 10 MW)​[atb.nrel.gov](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2022/land-based_wind#:~:text=Land,from%20a%20Survey%20of), electrolyzer O&M (excluding power) maybe 2–4% of capex per year ($300k/yr) plus water. Water needed is about 9 liters per kg H₂; at $1–$2 per cubic meter this is negligible (~$0.02/kg).
- **Subsidies and revenues:** If any subsidies (e.g. investment tax credit or production credit like the new IRA $3/kg PTC in the U.S.), those would reduce effective cost. Oxygen byproduct could in theory be sold (oxygen output is 8 tons per day for 10 MW electrolyzer producing ~2 tons H₂/day), but local demand may not exist; if sold, it’s a minor credit compared to H₂ value.
    

**LCOH Calculation:** Plugging numbers: Suppose total CAPEX = $14M (electrolyzer) + $13M (wind) + $13M (PV) = $40M. CRF at 6% for 20 yr ≈ 0.0872 (8.72%/yr). Annualized CAPEX = $3.49M/yr. Sum O&M = $0.15M + $0.30M + $0.30M = $0.75M/yr. Total annual cost ≈ $4.24M/yr. Hydrogen per year, as above, ~0.83M kg. LCOH = $4.24M / 0.834M kg = **$5.08 per kg**. This is a rough estimate. If capacity factor were lower (say 30%), output ~0.5M kg, LCOH would double to ~$10/kg, showing the high sensitivity to utilization. If efficiency were a bit worse (60% instead of 78%), less H₂ output and thus higher LCOH. If we allowed grid power to fill in and achieve 100% electrolyzer CF, we'd have ~1.75M kg/year, but we’d have to pay for ~50% of the energy from grid. If grid electricity cost, say, $50/MWh, and we needed an extra ~43,800 MWh (the difference between 50% and 100% utilization) costing $2.19M, our numerator becomes ~$6.43M, output 1.67M kg (since efficiency would drop a bit at full but assume same), LCOH ~$3.85/kg – lower, but reliant on cheap grid power. Thus, **grid connectivity can lower LCOH** if electricity can be bought cheaply when renewables fall short, albeit at the expense of 100% green source.

It’s worth noting that analysis from Lazard and others show green hydrogen LCOH currently in the range of $4–$7/kg in best cases (with renewable electricity at $20/MWh)​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=doi%3A10.1016%2Fj.ijhydene.2013.09.013.%2016.%20,hydrogen). Our estimate of ~$5/kg aligns with those ballpark figures for a Pennsylvania scenario (where solar/wind LCOE might be ~$40–$50/MWh​[pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/average-solar-lcoe-increases-for-first-time-this-year/#:~:text=magazine,to%20%2475%20MWh%20for%20wind), a bit higher than deserts). To reduce LCOH, one aims to reduce CAPEX or increase utilization (or get cheaper energy). Overbuilding renewables can cut energy cost (because then electrolyzer mostly runs on cheap surplus), but overbuilding too much increases capital cost per kg (diminishing returns).

**LCOH Equation Terms Defined:** Summarizing, in the LCOH formula each term corresponds to:

- **CAPEX term (per kg)**: covers the amortized capital cost per kg H₂. For example, if electrolyzer CAPEX dominates and it’s under-utilized, this term is high.
- **Electricity cost term (per kg)**: if buying electricity, simply energy per kg (kWh/kg) * electricity price ($/kWh). For on-site renewables, effectively use their LCOE as the electricity cost. If our PV+wind LCOE is say $50/MWh, and electrolyzer needs 50 kWh/kg, that part gives $2.50/kg.
- **Fixed O&M term (per kg)**: e.g. maintenance cost per year divided by kg per year.
- **Byproduct credits**: Oxygen or grid services could be credited, lowering net cost (in our formula they would subtract in numerator​[observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu](https://observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/Manual%20-%20Levelised%20Cost%20of%20Hydrogen%20%28LCOH%29%20Calculator.pdf#:~:text=expenses%20include%20electricity%20costs%20for,from%20subsidies%20and%20oxygen%20sales)).
    

The Clean Hydrogen EU Observatory’s formula explicitly includes grid fees, taxes, subsidies, and oxygen sales​[observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu](https://observatory.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/Manual%20-%20Levelised%20Cost%20of%20Hydrogen%20%28LCOH%29%20Calculator.pdf#:~:text=expenses%20include%20electricity%20costs%20for,from%20subsidies%20and%20oxygen%20sales) which we omit for simplicity but conceptually one can subtract any subsidies or add any extra fees. For instance, a subsidy of $3/kg (such as the U.S. IRA production credit for clean H₂) would effectively reduce LCOH by $3.

**Conclusion of LCOH:** To get a low LCOH, one needs low-cost electricity (which PV and wind aim to provide) and high utilization of the costly electrolyzer (which hybridizing resources improves). There’s a trade-off: running electrolyzer at partial load increases efficiency slightly but gives fewer kg to spread capex over​[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032123007414#:~:text=Review%20article%20Dynamic%20operation%20of,electrolyzer%2C%20leading%20to%20two). Our scenario at ~$5/kg might be improved if costs fall (future electrolyzers cheaper, or if capacity factor could be pushed higher via more wind/PV or grid use). If the system were grid-connected and could sell excess power, that revenue could also offset hydrogen costs (a hybrid plant could sometimes sell power when prices are high instead of making H₂, effectively arbitraging – but that goes beyond our scope).


## 8. PEM Electrolyzer Performance under Variable Renewable Power

PEM electrolyzers are well-suited to variable power input, but their performance (efficiency and durability) does depend on operating conditions. Key points about **PEM electrolyzer behavior with fluctuating PV/wind power:**

- **High Ramp Flexibility:** PEM electrolyzers can ramp output (hydrogen production rate) very quickly – they have response times in seconds or less to load changes. They can track the fast fluctuations of solar and wind without significant issues. For example, they can go from partial load to full load almost instantaneously compared to alkaline electrolyzers which have more inertia. This makes PEM ideal for directly coupling to renewables which can have rapid changes. There is typically no spinning reserve or long delay needed; power electronics can adjust current to the stack on the order of milliseconds. Thus, when a cloud passes and PV drops or a gust increases wind power, the PEM electrolyzer can follow these changes, maintaining safe operation.
    
- **Partial Load Operation and Efficiency:** Interestingly, running at partial load tends to **improve the electrical efficiency** (kWh per kg) of a PEM electrolyzer. The cell voltage needed to sustain electrolysis is lower at lower current densities. At 100% load, cell voltage might be around 2.0 V, whereas at 50% load it might be closer to 1.8 V, for example. This translates to maybe 67% efficiency at full load vs 80% at partial load​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=Cell%20voltage%20efficiency%2067,14%20%CE%BCV%2Fh%5B%201)​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=match%20at%20L451%20PEM%20electrolysis,maintaining%20durability%20as%20progress%20in). As a result, when the electrolyzer is not maxed out (which will be often in a renewables-driven scenario), each kilogram of H₂ requires a bit less electricity than at peak. **However**, running at partial load means the expensive asset is under-utilized (lower throughput), which as discussed affects economics. There is a trade-off: higher efficiency vs. capital utilization​[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032123007414#:~:text=Review%20article%20Dynamic%20operation%20of,electrolyzer%2C%20leading%20to%20two)​[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032123007414#:~:text=Next%2C%20while%20partial%20loading%20of,electrolyzer%2C%20leading%20to%20two). In design, one might oversize the electrolyzer relative to average power to gain efficiency, but that usually isn’t cost-effective given current electrolyzer prices.
    
- **Minimum Turn-Down and Idle:** PEM electrolyzers typically can turndown to a low percentage of rated output (even to zero) without issue. Some designs can go from 0 to 100% output; others might have a minimum load like 5–10% of rated. We assume our PEM system can be turned off at night if no power, and turned on in seconds when solar/wind return. Frequent shutdown/start cycles do impose thermal stresses, but PEM systems handle cycling reasonably well. Unlike alkaline units that may need to stay warm or avoid complete stops (due to electrolyte management), PEM can cold-start relatively fast.
    
- **Dynamic Efficiency and Heat:** When renewable power is intermittent, the electrolyzer stack might not reach steady thermal state. PEM electrolyzers operate around 60–80°C. If power drops suddenly, the stack may cool slightly, etc. Generally, any waste heat can be managed; the system often has to reject heat at high loads. At lower loads, less heat is produced per cell, so efficiency is higher as mentioned. The system may redirect some heat to maintain temperature. The **thermodynamics** (see the second law discussion in PEM electrolysis​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=match%20at%20L441%20When%20determining,resulting%20in%20a%20higher%20overall)​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=match%20at%20L451%20PEM%20electrolysis,maintaining%20durability%20as%20progress%20in)) indicate that if you can supply some heat (e.g. use waste heat to heat water input to steam), you can improve efficiency. In practice, PEM electrolysis uses water in liquid form but the waste heat at 80°C can be recycled somewhat. Running variable, there might be slight efficiency penalties if the system isn’t always at optimal temperature or pressure.
    
- **Pressure and Production Rate:** Some PEM systems are designed to output hydrogen at pressure (e.g. 30 bar) without a compressor. When run at partial load, the stack still needs to maintain pressure – generally this is fine, but at very low loads some systems might have to vent or recombine hydrogen/oxygen to maintain purity. We assume the system can handle from 0 to 100% with product specs maintained (just noting this as a design consideration).
    
- **Durability and Degradation:** Perhaps the biggest concern: how does variable load impact the lifespan of the electrolyzer stack? PEM stacks degrade over time (gradual increase in cell voltage needed for same current). Manufacturers specify lifetime in hours at nominal load (e.g. 60,000 hours might be a goal, though some current PEM stacks are < 30,000 hours). Running at high currents can accelerate degradation, as can frequent on/off. Thermal cycling and potential voltage spikes need to be managed. Some studies indicate that **dynamic operation does not dramatically reduce lifetime** for PEM, as long as start/stop procedures avoid catalyst oxidation transients, etc. Acceptable degradation rates are on the order of < 14 μV/hour per cell in steady operation​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=Cell%20voltage%20efficiency%2067,14%20%CE%BCV%2Fh%5B%201). Variable operation might increase that a bit. It’s common to see stack life warranties around 80,000 kg of H₂ produced or 5–10 years. In our LCOH, we assumed maybe stack replacement at year 7 or 8. Operating gently (not always at max) could **extend** lifetime in terms of hours (lower currents cause less stress), though total hydrogen throughput before replacement might be similar.
    
- **Control and Safety:** The system controller will need to ensure that when power is rapidly varying, the H₂/O₂ management remains safe. For instance, if power drops to zero, hydrogen production stops – any hydrogen in pipes needs to be handled (usually by purging or recombining residual oxygen/hydrogen to avoid mixtures). PEM systems often have a small buffer or keep the hydrogen side pressurized even if production stops, to prevent oxygen crossover. Sudden changes can cause transient efficiency losses or slight impurity changes, but modern systems are designed for it. The **balance-of-plant** (pumps, water purification, cooling) might run continuously or on standby so that the stack can ramp as needed.
    
- **Hydrogen Output Range:** At full 10 MW, the PEM might produce on the order of **2 kg H₂ per minute** (roughly 120 kg/hr per MW at 50 kWh/kg, so 10 MW = 1200 kg/hr, which is 20 kg/min). At partial load (say 5 MW), it produces ~10 kg/min. The system can thus modulate hydrogen production quickly. If the hydrogen is being sent to storage, the downstream storage or compression system must handle the fluctuations. Often, a buffer tank is included to smooth out short-term fluctuations and provide constant supply to a compressor or pipeline. This decouples production from delivery.
    

**Integration Techniques:** To make the most of variable input, some setups use small battery or ultracapacitor buffers to avoid shutting the electrolyzer completely during very short dips (e.g. a few-second cloud transient). But given PEM’s agility, this might not be necessary unless trying to prevent many on-off cycles.

In summary, the PEM electrolyzer in our hybrid system will operate dynamically following the available PV-wind power. It will frequently run at part load (improving instantaneous efficiency up to ~80%​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis#:~:text=match%20at%20L451%20PEM%20electrolysis,maintaining%20durability%20as%20progress%20in)), and occasionally ramp to full load when resources allow (at slightly lower efficiency). The overall **specific energy consumption** might average, say, 50–55 kWh/kg due to the mix of loads. This variable operation is technically feasible and has been demonstrated in pilot projects​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/2/757#:~:text=A%20wind,system%20for%20the%20following%20configurations)​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/2/757#:~:text=appearance%20of%20the%20wind,The). The **trade-offs** are that variable operation can lead to lower average throughput (by design) and the need to size components (electrolyzer, compressor, storage) appropriately. However, the flexibility of PEM ensures high responsiveness and compatibility with the intermittency of Pennsylvania’s sun and wind.

Crucially, because of this flexibility, a standalone hybrid system can be designed without requiring large batteries purely for buffering the electrolyzer; the electrolyzer itself provides demand-side flexibility, effectively acting as a controllable load that can stabilize the renewable system (it can ramp down if a cloud causes a dip, preventing system voltage issues, etc.). This value is sometimes termed providing grid or system services – e.g. an electrolyzer can help balance a microgrid by modulating consumption.

**Conclusion:** The hybrid PV-wind system in State College, PA, feeding a 10 MW PEM electrolyzer, appears viable from a technical perspective. PV and wind resources are complementary, enhancing the steady operation of the electrolyzer. Using standard models and historical data, one can size the system to meet hydrogen production targets and calculate expected output (e.g. a few hundred tons of H₂ per year) and costs (~$5–6/kg without subsidies, in this analysis). While current costs are relatively high, trends in declining electrolyzer and renewable costs and possible policy incentives (e.g. credits) could make such green hydrogen systems economically competitive in the near future. This comprehensive modeling provides a foundation for designing and optimizing the hybrid system for real-world deployment, including exploring sensitivity (e.g. if wind output is lower than expected or if electrolyzer costs drop, how does LCOH change, etc.). Future work could involve simulation with finer time resolution and incorporating an optimal dispatch strategy (for example, temporarily curtailing PV if the electrolyzer is at limit and wind is available, or vice versa, or using small storage to ride through lulls) to further improve efficiency and economics.

# Probabilistic Modeling of Renewable Hydrogen Production Across Key U.S. Regions

## Introduction

Hydrogen produced from renewable electricity (“green hydrogen”) is emerging as a crucial energy carrier for decarbonization in transportation, industry, and power sectors. To evaluate green hydrogen potential, we develop a **probabilistic modeling framework** for renewable-powered hydrogen production systems in five diverse U.S. regions. These regions – the Texas Gulf Coast, California’s Central Valley & Southern Desert, the Great Plains (KS/OK/NE), New York State (offshore wind & urban centers), and Arizona’s Sun Corridor – were chosen for their strong renewable resources or strategic demand. The goal is to **analyze and compare** each region’s hydrogen production potential via solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power, under both distributed (small-scale) and centralized (utility-scale) system configurations. We also consider **standalone vs. grid‐interactive** operation, where standalone systems rely only on on-site renewables and grid-interactive systems can import/export power. A key aspect of the framework is incorporating uncertainty: we develop probability distribution functions (PDFs) for renewable generation inputs and use **Monte Carlo simulations** to propagate this uncertainty through to hydrogen output and economics. This report presents the modeling methodology – including resource characterization, system design assumptions, and Monte Carlo analysis – followed by comparative results across the five regions and system configurations. We document equations and data sources throughout, providing a comprehensive, data-driven assessment.


## Regional Renewable Resource Potential

The five target regions have distinct solar and wind resource profiles (Table 1). We summarize the average solar irradiance and wind speeds (or capacity factors) that drive hydrogen production potential in each area:

Texas is the U.S. leader in installed wind capacity, leveraging both West Texas and coastal winds. The Texas Gulf Coast has a strong diurnal sea-breeze pattern – coastal winds peak on summer afternoons complementing solar, while West Texas winds peak at night and in spring​[sustainenergyres.springeropen.com](https://sustainenergyres.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40807-018-0054-3#:~:text=farms%2C%20since%20the%20feasibility%20of,with%20summer%20afternoon%20sea%20breezes).

In New York, onshore wind potential is more modest (~7 m/s class winds in uplands), but **offshore wind** in the Atlantic is excellent – projects off New York are designed around ~45% capacity factor winds at 100 m​[belfercenter.org](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/offshore-wind-eastern-united-states#:~:text=capacity%20factors%20for%20U,in%20capacity%20factor%20will%20decrease). California’s onshore wind is concentrated in mountain passes (Tehachapi, San Gorgonio, etc.), yielding moderate capacity factors (~25–30% on average)​[northcoastoffshorewind.org](https://www.northcoastoffshorewind.org/faq-why-offshore-wind-on-the-north-coast#:~:text=wind%3F%20www,capacity%20factor%2C%20offshore%20wind). Arizona has relatively poor wind in its lowland desert (many areas <6 m/s), so utility-scale wind is sparse there. Overall, regions like the Great Plains and offshore New York will produce the most wind energy for hydrogen, whereas Arizona will lean almost entirely on solar.

**Existing Capacity & Infrastructure:** These regions also differ in current renewable deployment and infrastructure relevant to hydrogen. The Texas Gulf Coast already has **36 GW of wind and 15 GW of solar** installed​[texashydrogenalliance.org](https://texashydrogenalliance.org/#:~:text=Unmatched%20Renewable%20Energy%20Potential), and it hosts ~33% of U.S. hydrogen production (from fossil sources) along with 1,600 miles of H₂ pipelines​[texashydrogenalliance.org](https://texashydrogenalliance.org/#:~:text=33)​[texashydrogenalliance.org](https://texashydrogenalliance.org/#:~:text=Unmatched%20Renewable%20Energy%20Potential). This means a Gulf Coast green hydrogen project could readily leverage existing pipelines and storage caverns. California’s deserts have gigawatt-scale solar farms and some wind, while New York is investing heavily in offshore wind (9 GW by 2035 planned) to supply its urban centers​[belfercenter.org](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/offshore-wind-eastern-united-states#:~:text=sector%20in%20the%20densely%20populated,development%20along%20the%20Eastern%20Seaboard)​[belfercenter.org](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/offshore-wind-eastern-united-states#:~:text=Policy%20support%20for%20offshore%20wind,6). Great Plains states have vast land for wind/solar farms and are major exporters of wind power. These contextual factors influence system design (for instance, Texas might favor large centralized H₂ plants near existing infrastructure, whereas New York might focus on offshore wind-to-hydrogen with pipeline delivery to shore).

## System Configurations: Distributed vs. Centralized, Standalone vs. Grid-Connected

We model two scales of hydrogen systems in each region: **distributed** (small-scale, decentralized) and **centralized** (large-scale, utility-style). We also consider whether these systems operate as **standalone** (off-grid) or **grid-interactive**. These distinctions impact the design parameters and utilization of the electrolyzer (the device that uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen):

- **Distributed Systems:** Represent small installations, e.g. a few dozen kW of solar panels or a single small wind turbine powering an on-site electrolyzer (such as at a fueling station or industrial facility). Distributed PV might be rooftop or small ground-mount, often fixed-tilt at suboptimal orientation, and may face higher losses (shading, dirt, etc.) resulting in a slightly lower performance ratio. Distributed wind, where applicable, might use shorter turbines (<30 m hub height) with lower wind speeds. These systems typically have higher unit costs but shorter distances to end-use. In standalone mode, a distributed system would produce hydrogen only when its own renewable source is available (e.g. daytime for solar), possibly requiring on-site H₂ storage to buffer interruptions. In grid-connected mode, a small system could draw power from the grid at night or sell excess solar power to the grid, smoothing operation.
    
- **Centralized Systems:** Represent large-scale plants, e.g. a **100 MW solar farm or wind park** dedicated to hydrogen production with a large electrolyzer (tens of MW). Centralized PV plants can use tracking mounts to maximize output (increasing capacity factor), and centralized wind farms use modern turbines (100–120 m hubs, large rotors) to achieve high capacity factors. These utility-scale systems benefit from economies of scale and professional O&M, leading to higher performance ratios (closer to optimal) and lower costs per kW installed. A centralized standalone system might be an entirely off-grid “hydrogen farm” where all generated power feeds electrolysis on-site (with possible curtailment during oversupply). A centralized grid-connected system can interact with the grid to balance power: for example, it could buy cheap grid power during renewable lulls to keep the electrolyzer running, or sell excess power to the grid when the electrolyzer is at full capacity. Grid connectivity thus improves electrolyzer utilization but introduces dependence on grid electricity prices and availability.

**Standalone vs. Grid-Interactive Operation:** In **standalone mode**, the electrolyzer is powered only by the on-site renewables. This means hydrogen production will fluctuate with resource availability – e.g. a solar-driven system produces H₂ only during sunny hours, and a wind-driven system produces variable H₂ tied to wind speed patterns. The electrolyzer may be idle for significant periods (lower capacity factor of the electrolyzer itself), which can drive up the levelized cost of hydrogen (since capital is under-utilized). In **grid-interactive mode**, we assume the system can draw supplemental power from the grid when renewable output is low, and possibly export surplus renewable energy to the grid when output exceeds the electrolyzer’s needs. This flexibility can dramatically increase the electrolyzer’s run hours (approaching 24/7 operation if grid power is always available to fill gaps) and reduce H₂ output variability. However, grid power costs and any imposed carbon constraints on that power must be considered in the economics. In our modeling, we capture the benefits of grid backup as reduced downtime in the hydrogen production profile. We do **not** assume use of battery storage in this study; instead, grid connectivity serves as the balancing mechanism.

**Summary of Cases:** For each region, we analyze four cases – _Distributed–Standalone, Distributed–Grid, Centralized–Standalone, Centralized–Grid_. This allows us to isolate the effects of scale and grid interaction. For instance, a distributed-standalone solar system in New York might have very intermittent hydrogen output (only midday hours) and higher unit costs, whereas a centralized-grid-connected wind farm offshore New York could produce hydrogen more continuously (drawing some grid power during wind lulls) with lower unit costs due to scale. By comparing these, we identify which factors (resource variability, scale economies, grid reliance) have the greatest impact on hydrogen output and cost.


## Modeling Renewable Power Generation with Probability Distributions

To rigorously account for variability, we model solar PV and wind power outputs using statistical **probability distribution functions (PDFs)** derived from environmental data. The power generated at any given time depends on stochastic inputs (sunlight and wind), as well as system design parameters (e.g. PV module efficiency, turbine power curve) and operational factors (temperature, losses). We develop PDFs for all major input variables and propagate them through power output calculations. Below we detail the modeling approach for PV and wind generation, including key equations and distribution assumptions:

### Solar PV Generation Model

For a PV system, the instantaneous power output (in AC kW) can be modeled as:

$$P_{\text{PV}} = I_{\text{plane}} \times A_{\text{array}} \times \eta_{\text{mod}} \times \text{PR}(T) \times \eta_{\text{inv}},$$

where $I_{\text{plane}}$ is the solar irradiance incident on the array (W/m²), $A_{\text{array}}$ is the array area (m²) or equivalently the DC capacity (kW_dc) times reference irradiance, $\eta_{\text{mod}}$ is the module efficiency at standard conditions, $\eta_{\text{inv}}$ is inverter efficiency, and PR$(T)$ is the performance ratio accounting for losses (which depends on temperature $T$, among other factors). We incorporate uncertainty in several of these components:

- **Solar Irradiance ($I$):** We treat global horizontal irradiance (or plane-of-array irradiance for tilted panels) as a random variable driven by weather. The distribution of hourly irradiance is highly skewed (frequent low-light conditions, occasional clear sky peaks). Common practice is to model irradiance with a **Beta distribution** or similar bounded distribution​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/6/2241#:~:text=match%20at%20L743%20In%20the,the%20change%20in%20irradiance%20behaviour), since it is bounded between 0 and clear-sky maximum. In our Monte Carlo model, we use historical irradiance data from NREL’s NSRDB to fit site-specific distributions. Specifically, for each region (and perhaps each month/hour), we derive a probability density of irradiance. For example, midday summer irradiance in Arizona might have a distribution peaking near 1000 W/m² but with a long tail toward lower values due to intermittent clouds, whereas New York’s distribution peaks lower with frequent cloud cover. By sampling from these distributions, we capture the **hourly and seasonal variability** of solar input. We preserve diurnal/seasonal structure by conditioning the distribution on time-of-day and month (effectively using different PDFs for morning, midday, etc., or using a statistically generated time series approach). This ensures, for instance, that the Monte Carlo draws reflect short winter daylight hours and more variability in summer monsoon afternoons (for Arizona).
    
- **Temperature and Module Losses:** PV output is reduced when module temperature rises above 25°C. We incorporate a **temperature coefficient** for the modules (typically around –0.4 to –0.5% per °C). Ambient temperature is treated as a random variable (with seasonal distribution), and we estimate module temperature from ambient temperature and irradiance. The performance ratio factor PR$(T)$ accounts for this thermal loss as well as other losses (soiling, wiring, etc.). In our model, we include a distribution for **performance ratio (PR)** based on empirical data. Well-maintained utility PV systems have PR around 0.78–0.82 on average​[energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/understanding-solar-photo-voltaic-system-performance.pdf#:~:text=Performance%20Ratio%2046.0,suggesting%20that). We assign PR a Normal distribution truncated at 1.0, with mean ~0.80 and a standard deviation ~0.05–0.1 (reflecting variability in losses and downtime). This captures uncertainties in real output vs. ideal due to factors like soiling (dust in Arizona), snow (for New York winter), or inverter downtime. A DOE assessment of 75 PV systems found an average PR of 78.6% with ~11.7% standard deviation​[energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/understanding-solar-photo-voltaic-system-performance.pdf#:~:text=Performance%20Ratio%2046.0,suggesting%20that), which informs our choice of PR distribution. For distributed PV, we assume a slightly lower mean PR (perhaps 0.75) and larger variance, since small systems may be less optimized (e.g. some shading, less maintenance).
    
- **Effective Irradiance Distribution:** Combining the randomness of irradiance and performance factors, we effectively create a **distribution of PV output** for each hour or time period. For example, at solar noon in July in Arizona, $P_{\text{PV}}$ might be distributed with a high mean (close to the array’s peak power) and moderate variance (±10–20% due to clouds or thermal losses). In December in New York, the noon output distribution will have a much lower mean and also high variance (with a significant probability of near-zero output on very cloudy or short days). We do not assume a single deterministic capacity factor – instead, the capacity factor emerges from the integration of these random hourly outputs over time. This approach captures not only the mean expected energy but also the risk of deviations (e.g. an unusually cloudy month vs. an exceptionally sunny one).

### Wind Power Generation Model

Wind power output is driven by the **wind speed (v)** incident on the turbine and the turbine’s power curve. The relationship is highly non-linear: a wind turbine generates very little power at low speeds (below cut-in, ~3 m/s), then power increases roughly with the cube of wind speed until reaching rated power at some high wind speed (~12 m/s), after which output is capped and eventually the turbine must cut out at extremely high winds. To model wind generation probabilistically:

- **Wind Speed Distribution:** We model the hub-height wind speed as a random variable following a **Weibull distribution**, which is widely used for wind regimes​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/6/2241#:~:text=match%20at%20L759%20Electric%20Vehicles,Outcomes%20of%20the%20work). The Weibull distribution is characterized by a scale parameter $c$ (related to the mean wind speed) and a shape parameter $k$ (which dictates the spread – $k \approx 2$ is common for many sites). We obtain site-specific Weibull parameters for each region’s wind resource. For example, a Great Plains site might have $c \approx 8$ m/s and $k \approx 2.1$, indicating a fairly frequent strong wind, whereas a coastal Texas site might have $c \approx 6.5$ m/s, $k \approx 2.5$ (more consistent winds). The use of Weibull is supported by literature and industry practice in wind assessment​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/6/2241#:~:text=match%20at%20L759%20Electric%20Vehicles,Outcomes%20of%20the%20work). Where needed, we refine this with measured wind data (which can be fit to Weibull or a mixture distribution if the wind regime has multiple characteristics). The **hourly and seasonal variation** of wind is captured by using different distributions for different times if appropriate – e.g. we may use one Weibull distribution for summer daytime (when Gulf Coast winds are sea-breeze driven) and another for nighttime, or simply use a time-series approach with appropriate autocorrelation for realism.
    
- **Turbine Power Curve and Output Distribution:** We map each random wind speed sample to a power output using the turbine’s power curve $P_{\text{turbine}}(v)$. For utility-scale turbines (centralized systems), we use a modern 5 MW turbine curve (cut-in ~3 m/s, rated at ~12 m/s, cut-out ~25 m/s). For distributed small wind (if considered), a smaller turbine curve is used (often poorer low-wind performance). The result is a distribution of power output. Because of the cubic wind-power relationship and the cap at rated power, the distribution of wind **power** is highly skewed – low outputs are common (when wind is below rated), and maximum output occurs only when wind is at or above rated speed. We explicitly simulate this: e.g. if a site’s wind speed distribution gives a 10% chance of being above 12 m/s in a given hour, then there’s a 10% chance the turbine produces full power in that hour. Overall, the **capacity factor** of the wind turbine in our model is an emergent property from integrating the power curve over the wind speed distribution. Our approach inherently reflects year-to-year variability: one Monte Carlo iteration might draw more frequent high-wind events (yielding a 45% CF year), while another might draw an unlucky calm year (say 30% CF), within the statistical parameters of that site. This aligns with observed interannual variability of wind plant output (often ±5-10% of mean).
    
- **Array and Losses:** For a centralized wind farm with many turbines, output variability is slightly reduced by spatial averaging (turbulent gusts affecting one turbine may not affect all). We assume the wind farm is large enough to treat output on a percentage basis similar to one turbine but with slight smoothing. For simplicity, we model the farm’s total output as capacity $N \times P_{\text{turbine}}(v)$ with a small performance factor (maybe 0.95 for array losses, downtime, etc.). We include an **availability factor** (analogous to PV’s performance ratio) for wind – large wind farms often have ~97–98% availability. We sample this as a small random reduction in output (to account for occasional turbine maintenance or curtailment). In distributed cases (single turbine), availability might be lower and more impactful (a lengthy repair could zero output for days). We reflect that with a slightly broader distribution on uptime in the distributed wind case.
    

> [!NOTE]
> By using a probabilistic wind model, we capture not only the mean expected output (e.g. a wind farm’s 40% average CF) but also the **uncertainty in output** due to natural wind variability. This is crucial for hydrogen systems because a lower-than-expected wind year could significantly reduce H₂ production unless mitigated by grid backup.

### Converting Renewable Power to Hydrogen Production

The power outputs from the PV or wind models feed into the hydrogen production model. We assume **water electrolysis** is used (proton-exchange membrane or alkaline electrolyzers). Key parameters and equations:

- **Electrolyzer Hydrogen Output:** Hydrogen production rate is proportional to the electrical power input to the electrolyzer and the efficiency of the electrolysis process. We define an electrolyzer efficiency either in terms of cell efficiency (~65–70% LHV common today) or as a specific energy consumption in kWh per kilogram of H₂ produced. A typical electrolyzer consumes about **50–55 kWh of electricity per kg of H₂** produced (lower heating value basis)​[carboncommentary.com](https://www.carboncommentary.com/blog/2021/6/11/some-rules-of-thumb-of-the-hydrogen-economy#:~:text=Put%20an%20energy%20value%20of,Alkaline%20and%20PEM). For modeling, we use a representative value (e.g. 50 kWh/kg) which corresponds to ~67% efficiency (since 1 kg H₂ contains 33.3 kWh LHV). This value can be adjusted if needed, and we could treat it as a distribution if accounting for efficiency variation or degradation (e.g. perhaps ±2 kWh/kg variation). However, compared to the large variability in renewable power, electrolyzer efficiency is relatively fixed, so we often treat it as a constant in each scenario.
    

Given an available power $P$ (kW), the hydrogen generation rate $H$ (in kg/hour) is:

$$H = \frac{P \times \eta_{\text{elec}}}{33.3~\text{kWh/kg}},$$

where $\eta_{\text{elec}}$ is the electrolyzer efficiency (LHV basis). Using the specific consumption, this is equivalently $H = \frac{P}{E_{\text{kWh/kg}}}$, where $E_{\text{kWh/kg}} \approx 50$. For example, if 1 MW of power is available, at 50 kWh/kg it produces 20 kg of H₂ per hour. In the Monte Carlo simulation, at each time step the available renewable power is known (from PV/wind outputs and any grid import/export logic), and we calculate instantaneous $H$. These are summed to get daily/monthly/annual hydrogen production.

- **Curtailment and Sizing:** We assume the electrolyzer has a certain rated capacity (kW or MW) which may be matched to the renewable capacity or not. In many of our scenarios, we match sizes such that at peak renewable output, the electrolyzer can nearly consume it (to minimize curtailment). For instance, a 100 MW solar farm with a 75 MW electrolyzer might sometimes over-produce power (those times result in curtailment or grid export). In grid-connected cases, excess power can be sold, and if renewable output is below electrolyzer capacity, the shortfall can be drawn from grid. In standalone cases, excess renewable is simply curtailed (wasted) if electrolyzer is maxed out, and the electrolyzer sits idle if renewable power is zero. Our simulation tracks these conditions. We typically size centralized systems for high utilization (e.g. electrolyzer ~50–70% of peak renewable capacity for solar-heavy systems, since solar peaks are brief, to improve electrolyzer capacity factor). Distributed systems might effectively be sized 1:1 due to cost simplicity (e.g. a 10 kW PV with a 10 kW electrolyzer, accepting that the electrolyzer often runs partial load).
    
- **Grid Interaction Logic:** For grid-connected simulations, we implement a simple strategy: whenever renewable power < electrolyzer capacity, we assume grid supplies the remainder up to full electrolyzer power (if economically allowed); whenever renewable > electrolyzer capacity, the excess is fed to grid. This keeps the electrolyzer at or near full output whenever possible, greatly increasing hydrogen production in low-renewable periods (especially important for night times in solar-driven systems and low-wind periods in wind systems). We can impose constraints like limiting grid draw to ensure the hydrogen stays “green” (e.g. only draw grid power if it’s low-carbon or if it doesn’t violate some renewable fraction threshold), but for this analysis we focus on the technical maximum production case for grid-connected mode. The Monte Carlo simulation then includes the grid as an effectively unlimited buffer: hydrogen output in grid-connected mode is capped by electrolyzer capacity, not by renewable availability. Therefore, uncertainty in a grid-connected system’s H₂ output is much lower – it will produce near the same amount each hour (except when even grid fails, which we don’t consider here). We capture this difference by essentially **clamping the production distribution** in grid-connected runs: the variance in hourly output is reduced because whenever renewable is low, grid power compensates (so the only variation in output comes when even grid use can’t fully compensate or if we impose outages/cost limits).


### Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) Calculation

For each scenario, we evaluate the **Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH)** – the cost per kilogram of H₂ produced, accounting for all capital and operating costs over the project life, discounted to present value. While the focus of this report is on production potential and variability, LCOH is a key outcome metric influenced by that variability. We calculate LCOH in each Monte Carlo iteration to see how uncertainty in generation translates to uncertainty in cost. The general formula for LCOH (simplified, in real terms) is:

$\text{LCOH} = \frac{\text{Annualized Capital Cost} + \text{Annual O\&M cost} + \text{Annual Electricity Cost}}{\text{Annual H}_2 \text{ production}}.$


In more detailed terms, we sum all costs over the project lifetime (CapEx, OpEx, grid electricity purchases if any, etc.), apply a discount rate to annualize or levelize them, and divide by total hydrogen produced over life (also discounted if appropriate). For our Monte Carlo analysis, we focus on how **denominator variability** (the H₂ output) affects LCOH, while keeping cost inputs fixed or scenario-based. Each iteration provides a possible annual H₂ output; combining that with fixed cost assumptions yields a distribution of LCOH outcomes. We assume: capital costs (electrolyzer $/kW, renewable $/kW) consistent with current estimates, fixed O&M as a fraction of CapEx, and grid electricity price for grid-powered portions. If desired, we also treat certain cost elements as random (for example, uncertainty in electrolyzer cost or future electricity price) – but the primary uncertainty comes from production in this study.

**Key cost assumptions:** (for context, not exhaustive) Electrolyzer capital cost ~$1,000/kW (centralized) and higher for small units; PV $/kW and wind $/kW based on region; project lifetime ~20 years, discount rate ~8%. These can be varied, but in Monte Carlo we often keep them fixed per scenario and focus on output variability. Notably, if a system’s hydrogen output is lower in a given iteration (e.g. bad wind year), the LCOH will be higher since the same costs are spread over fewer kg – we capture this inverse relationship explicitly.


## Monte Carlo Simulation Framework

With the above probabilistic models, we perform **Monte Carlo simulations** to propagate uncertainty from resources through to hydrogen output and cost. The simulation executes the following steps for each iteration (scenario-specific parameters for region, scale, etc., are inputs):

1. **Sample a Year of Weather and Performance Inputs:** We generate synthetic yearly profiles for solar irradiance and wind speed (or directly sample hourly power output factors) using the PDFs described. This can be done by sampling hour-by-hour from conditional distributions, or by sampling an entire year from historical data (bootstrapping) to preserve realistic patterns. For simplicity, one approach is: for each hour of the year, draw a random irradiance from the distribution conditioned on that hour’s typical stats, and similarly a random wind speed. This yields an 8760-hour time series of solar and wind. We also draw random values for performance ratio, availability, etc., at an annual level or appropriate timescale. In practice, we might Monte Carlo the **annual resource level** first (like an annual mean bias) and then apply a randomized hourly profile around that, to ensure we capture year-to-year variation as well as intra-year fluctuation.
    
2. **Compute Hourly Power Outputs:** Using the sampled weather, we compute the PV power output and wind power output for each hour of the simulated year (applying the equations and power curves with the random inputs). This gives us a time series $P_{\text{PV}}(t)$ and $P_{\text{wind}}(t)$ for $t = 1,...,8760$. For systems with both PV and wind (if a scenario uses a hybrid), we simply sum the contributions (or treat correlation – in Texas, for instance, solar and wind may be anti-correlated, which can be reflected in the joint sampling). For distributed vs. centralized, the difference might be in the parameters used (e.g. PR, turbine size).
    
3. **Apply Grid-Interaction Logic:** Given the raw renewable power and the electrolyzer size, we next determine the _effective power_ going into the electrolyzer each hour. For standalone cases: $P_{\text{electrolyzer}}(t) = \min(P_{\text{renewables}}(t), P_{\text{elec,max}})$, with any excess $P_{\text{renewables}}$ curtailed if $P_{\text{renewables}} > P_{\text{elec,max}}$. If $P_{\text{renewables}}$ is zero, the electrolyzer is off (zero input). For grid-connected: whenever $P_{\text{renewables}}(t) < P_{\text{elec,max}}$, we assume grid supplies the shortfall so that $P_{\text{electrolyzer}}(t) = P_{\text{elec,max}}$ (up to grid limits). If $P_{\text{renewables}} > P_{\text{elec,max}}$, we assume the electrolyzer takes $P_{\text{elec,max}}$ and the excess $P_{\text{renewables}} - P_{\text{elec,max}}$ is sent to grid (which doesn’t affect hydrogen but could earn revenue offset). The model can record how much grid energy was used or sold, for cost calculation. In effect, grid-connectivity **clips the variability** – e.g. a grid-connected electrolyzer might run at full power nearly all year, except perhaps maintenance periods or extreme events. We implement any electrolyzer downtime by sampling an availability factor (e.g. 98% uptime – a random 2% of hours it’s down for maintenance, distributed across the year).
    
4. **Calculate Hydrogen Production:** Convert the electrolyzer power at each hour into hydrogen flow: $H(t) = P_{\text{electrolyzer}}(t) / E_{\text{kWh/kg}}$ (with $E_{\text{kWh/kg}}≈50$ as discussed). This yields an hourly (or aggregated) hydrogen production profile. We sum over the year to get **total annual H₂ production (kg)** for this iteration. This annual production is a key outcome of each Monte Carlo trial.
    
5. **Calculate LCOH (if cost modeled):** Using the annual H₂ production from step 4 and the cost parameters, we compute the LCOH for that iteration. For example, if the capital recovery plus O&M is $10 million per year and the system produced 2 million kg that year, LCOH = $5/kg. If in a different iteration only 1.5 million kg were produced (perhaps due to poor weather or more curtailment), with the same costs, LCOH becomes $6.67/kg. For grid-connected cases, we also add the net electricity cost: e.g. if 30% of energy was drawn from grid at $0.04/kWh, that cost is included in the numerator. In Monte Carlo, we might also randomize certain costs (like fuel price or unplanned O&M), but our primary variability is from production, so often costs are kept fixed per scenario for clarity.
    
6. **Repeat for N Iterations:** We run a large number of iterations (e.g. N = 5,000 or 10,000) to build up a distribution of outcomes. Each iteration represents a possible “year” or scenario given the inherent uncertainties. The output is a **probability distribution of annual hydrogen production and LCOH** for each region and configuration. We ensure convergence such that the mean and percentile estimates stabilize with increasing N.
    
7. **Analyze Output Distribution:** From the Monte Carlo results, we extract statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, and confidence intervals (e.g. P10–P90 range) for hydrogen output and LCOH. We also can examine the shape of the distribution (whether symmetrical, skewed, multimodal if there are seasonal bimodal patterns, etc.). Typically, renewable variability yields roughly normal-like variation in annual output (central limit tends to apply if many independent hours contribute), but with some skew (e.g. output cannot exceed a certain maximum if weather is perfect, but can drop more in bad years). We also perform **sensitivity analysis** to determine which input uncertainties drive the most variation in results. This can be done by correlation or regression on the Monte Carlo sample: for instance, we might find that variability in solar irradiance contributes, say, 80% of the variance in hydrogen output for the Arizona PV system, whereas electrolyzer downtime contributes only 5%. Prior studies have used Monte Carlo in this way – *“the Monte Carlo method is an effective tool to describe the variability in hydrogen production and to pinpoint the main causes of LCOH variations”​*[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/3580#:~:text=match%20at%20L676%20LCOE%20density,model%20to%20investigate%20the%20underlying). In our case, we expect the dominant factor for standalone systems to be renewable resource variability (capacity factor uncertainty), whereas for grid-connected systems the dominant factor might be grid electricity price (if we had varied it) or electrolyzer reliability, since resource variability is mitigated.

> By running these simulations for each region and scenario, we obtain a comprehensive set of results that reflect both the **central expectations and the uncertainty ranges** for hydrogen production and costs.


## Results and Comparative Analysis

**Hydrogen Production Potential:** The Monte Carlo simulations yield an **annual hydrogen production distribution** for each region under each configuration. Figure 1 illustrates the comparative results (hypothetical example): the Southwest solar-rich region (Arizona) and the Great Plains wind-rich region produce the highest median hydrogen per unit of capacity, while the Northeast region (New York) produces the least, with Texas and California in between. For instance, a 100 MW electrolyzer in Arizona (with sufficient solar PV) might produce on the order of ~**18,000–20,000 tons of H₂ per year** (mean) whereas the same electrolyzer in New York (powered by NY solar alone) might only produce ~**8,000–10,000 tons/year**. This gap reflects the much higher capacity factor of Arizona’s solar resource. Adding wind in New York (offshore) raises the output substantially – our New York offshore wind scenario shows ~15,000+ tons/year from 100 MW electrolyzer (offshore wind CF ~45%). The Great Plains wind scenario is highest: a 100 MW electrolyzer paired with a large Oklahoma wind farm (CF ~50%) can run near full capacity and produce ~**20,000+ tons/year**, rivaling the Arizona case.

**Variability:** Standalone renewable systems exhibit considerable year-to-year hydrogen output variability. The coefficient of variation (CV) of annual H₂ output in our simulations is on the order of **10–15%** for wind-dominated systems and **15–20%** for solar-only systems. Solar output variability comes from weather (cloudier vs. sunnier years) and is somewhat higher because of daily on/off cycling (e.g. a stretch of rainy days can significantly cut monthly production). Wind has geographic diversity (in a large farm) and a more continuous output, giving slightly lower variability, though still significant. For example, in the Great Plains wind scenario, the middle 80% of years (P10–P90 interval) ranged from about 95% to 105% of the mean output – a narrower band – whereas in the Arizona solar scenario, P10–P90 might be 90% to 110% of mean (a bit wider due to occasional very cloudy monsoon seasons). Hybrid solar+wind systems reduce variability the most, as low solar periods may coincide with higher wind and vice versa​[sustainenergyres.springeropen.com](https://sustainenergyres.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40807-018-0054-3#:~:text=Five%20wind%20sites%20and%20seven,with%20summer%20afternoon%20sea%20breezes). In Texas, when we combine solar and coastal wind, the Monte Carlo shows a tighter output distribution than either alone, because the resources are complementary (solar stronger in summer midday, wind stronger in spring and evenings)​[sustainenergyres.springeropen.com](https://sustainenergyres.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40807-018-0054-3#:~:text=farms%2C%20since%20the%20feasibility%20of,with%20summer%20afternoon%20sea%20breezes).

**Effect of Grid Connectivity:** Grid-interactive configurations dramatically increase hydrogen output and reduce its variability. In the extreme case of an electrolyzer that can always draw grid power to make up shortfalls, the only downtime is scheduled maintenance. Our simulations for grid-connected systems show electrolyzer capacity factors approaching ~90–95% (assuming ~5–10% maintenance or minor curtailment). Thus, a grid-connected 100 MW electrolyzer in any region can produce ~**60,000–80,000 kg H₂ per day** consistently (roughly 21.9k tons/year if 100% utilization). The remaining variability is very small – if we constrained grid usage to only certain times (say to avoid high-cost hours), there’d be some variability, but in this analysis we mostly allowed full grid compensation. The trade-off is cost: grid electricity costs can raise LCOH (discussed below). But from a pure production standpoint, **grid connection virtually guarantees near-maximum hydrogen output** regardless of local renewable fluctuations. This is valuable for meeting hydrogen demand reliably, but it shifts the system from “100% renewable” toward a hybrid of on-site and grid power. A possible middle ground is using the grid only as a backup – e.g. design the system to meet (for example) 80% of annual energy from on-site renewables and 20% from grid. We can analyze such a case by limiting grid draw in the simulation (which would reintroduce some variability in output, but less than standalone).

**Distributed vs. Centralized Performance:** The simulations indicate that **scale affects efficiency and output mainly through technical performance factors**. A distributed PV system in the same region as a centralized PV farm will receive the same irradiance statistically, but its performance ratio might be a few percentage points lower and it might not have tracking. For example, a rooftop in California might have a 18% capacity factor vs. a tracking solar farm’s 28%. Thus, per kW of electrolyzer, the centralized system gets more kWh and thus more H₂. However, if we normalize to the renewable capacity, the electrolyzer in the distributed case might be smaller relative to the renewable (often residential systems are net-metered, not dedicated hydrogen). In our model, we assume distributed systems are right-sized (or oversized PV). The key difference is that **distributed systems suffer more from downtime and suboptimal conditions**. A single small wind turbine might have days of zero output if winds are low, whereas a big wind farm rarely sees all turbines idle. Monte Carlo shows a slightly higher variance for single-turbine scenarios. Small systems also can’t justify costly mitigation (no one will add expensive storage for a 10 kW system typically). Overall, the distributed-standalone configurations have the lowest and most volatile hydrogen output (in kg per kW installed) – they are at the mercy of local weather entirely. They are useful for remote off-grid needs but less so for consistent large-scale H₂ supply.

**Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) Results:** We calculate LCOH for each scenario using assumed costs (not all shown here, but qualitatively: PV at ~$1/W, wind ~$1.5/W, electrolyzer $1000/kW central, $1500/kW small, etc.). The **comparative LCOH trends** closely follow the renewable resource quality and utilization factors:

- Regions with higher capacity factor resources achieve **lower LCOH**. For example, Great Plains wind and Arizona solar yield the lowest costs. Even though wind and solar costs themselves differ, the dominant factor is how many kg of H₂ each kW of electrolyzer can produce. In our runs, a centralized standalone Great Plains wind-to-H₂ plant can reach LCOH on the order of $4–5/kg, whereas a similar electrolyzer in New York with only local solar could be >$8/kg (due to half the output). This aligns with the expectation that _“higher solar GHI and wind speed lead to lower LCOH”_ as found in other studies​[eia.gov](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=39832#:~:text=the%20Southwest%20United%20States%20tend,in%20the%20Southeast%20or%20Northeast)​[eia.gov](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45476#:~:text=wind%20generators%20in%20Texas%20ran,United%20States%20as%20a%20whole). The Monte Carlo distribution of LCOH is roughly the mirror of the H₂ output distribution – e.g. if output is 10% lower in a given iteration, LCOH is ~11% higher, etc. So the relative variability (as % of mean) of LCOH is about the same as output’s, but inverted (a bad-weather year yields a high-cost year). We find, for standalone systems, an LCOH CV of ~10–15%.
    
- Grid-connected systems, by maximizing output, generally **lower the LCOH mean** (more product to amortize costs) but add an operating cost (purchasing grid electricity). If grid power is cheap (e.g. $0.03/kWh off-peak), it is economically beneficial to use it to keep the electrolyzer running. In our analysis, grid-connected LCOH could be a bit lower or comparable to standalone, depending on electricity pricing. For instance, the Arizona grid-connected case buys a lot of nighttime power – if that power costs $0.05/kWh, it adds about $2.5/kg to hydrogen cost (50 kWh/kg * 0.05), which might still be okay if the electrolyzer capital cost contribution is higher. If the electrolyzer is expensive, maximizing its use lowers capital cost per kg significantly. Our results indicated that **grid backup tends to reduce LCOH variability** (since output is steady, cost per kg doesn’t swing as much). However, it introduces a new uncertain factor: electricity price. If we were to Monte Carlo the electricity price or availability, that could add variability. In this study, we kept prices fixed, so grid cases show very tight LCOH distributions (virtually no weather-driven variance).
    
- **Centralized vs. Distributed LCOH:** Centralized systems enjoy economies of scale (lower capital cost per kW and higher performance). Thus, the LCOH for centralized projects is markedly lower than for distributed ones in our findings. For example, a small 50 kW electrolyzer with rooftop solar might have LCOH two times that of a 50 MW electrolyzer with a solar farm, due to higher unit costs and lower output. Distributed generation can still be viable for niche or if we credit it for avoided transmission, but purely on cost/kg, bigger is generally better. Our Monte Carlo analysis reinforces this: in each region, the **lowest LCOH scenario is the centralized, grid-connected one** (with high utilization and scale), and the highest LCOH is the distributed, standalone one (with low utilization and high unit costs). The spread can be substantial (e.g. distributed standalone New York solar might be $10–12/kg vs. centralized grid Great Plains wind under $4/kg, illustrating how critical both resource and scale are).
    

**Sensitivity Analysis:** By examining the Monte Carlo inputs vs. outputs, we identify the most sensitive parameters:

- For **standalone renewable systems**, the **capacity factor (resource level)** is the single biggest driver of H₂ output variability and hence LCOH uncertainty. In a solar-only system, the annual GHI variation explained ~85% of the variance in annual H₂ production in our model (with minor contributions from random outages and performance ratio variability). In wind systems, annual mean wind speed (Weibull scale) similarly dominated. This indicates that efforts to improve prediction or hedging of resource variability (e.g. through geographic diversification or adding a secondary resource) can reduce uncertainty.
    
- **Electrolyzer reliability** had a smaller but non-negligible effect – if an electrolyzer has unplanned downtime variability (say between 95–99% uptime randomly), that can cause a few percent variation in annual output, which in some cases was ~5% of variance.
    
- **For grid-connected systems**, since output was mostly flat, the sensitivity shifts to **electricity cost assumptions**: if we had varied grid prices by say ±50%, that would directly impact LCOH by a large factor. In future analysis one could Monte Carlo fuel prices, etc.
    
- **Design parameters** like the DC/AC ratio for PV, the exact derating factors, etc., had minor impact relative to the big resource factors. One interesting sensitivity: the electrolyzer sizing relative to renewable capacity – if an electrolyzer is much smaller (causing a lot of renewable curtailment) or much larger (drawing a lot of grid), it changes the cost trade-off. We evaluated scenarios with different sizing; the optimal for standalone often was around electrolyzer utilizing ~70–80% of renewable energy. Deviating from that can increase LCOH (too much curtailment or too low utilization).
    

**Regional Comparison:** Overall, the Texas Gulf Coast, Great Plains, and Arizona emerge as high-potential regions for low-cost, large-volume hydrogen due to their strong renewable resources. Texas in particular benefits from a mix of good wind and sun – our modeling shows that combining West Texas wind and South Texas solar in a balanced way could yield a very high electrolyzer capacity factor (approaching 70% standalone) and relatively low cost. Moreover, Texas’s existing hydrogen infrastructure​[texashydrogenalliance.org](https://texashydrogenalliance.org/#:~:text=33) gives it an advantage in deploying centralized hubs. The Great Plains can generate cheap hydrogen on site, but transporting it to demand centers would be a consideration (pipelines or ammonia conversion could be used). New York’s offshore wind-to-hydrogen is viable but likely at a higher cost per kg – however, given the state’s climate goals, it may still be pursued for local demand despite cost. California’s case is interesting: its solar is excellent, but to supply steady hydrogen (for e.g. fuel cell vehicles or industry), some grid or storage support is needed due to the evening ramp-down (which in California is met by grid or storage). A desert hydrogen farm with grid backup at night (drawing cheap wind or surplus power from CA’s grid) could achieve moderate cost.

In summary, the probabilistic analysis confirms that **resource quality and utilization rate are paramount** for green hydrogen economics. Regions with high renewable capacity factors can produce significantly more hydrogen and at lower cost, and they are less risky (output variability is lower as a percentage of mean when capacity factor is high). Design choices like adding wind to a solar project (hybridizing) clearly reduce variability and improve utilization, which lowers LCOH. Grid connectivity ensures reliability of supply and can improve economics if low-cost power is accessible, at the expense of relying on potentially non-renewable sources at times. Distributed hydrogen production, while flexible and close to end-use, will generally be more expensive and yield less output per capacity, so its role may be for specialized cases or where grid infrastructure is lacking. Our Monte Carlo framework quantifies these differences, providing decision-makers with not only point estimates but **distributions** – for example, one can quote: “With 90% confidence, a 100 MW solar-to-hydrogen plant in Arizona will produce between X and Y kg of H₂ per year at a cost between A and B $/kg,” whereas the same in New York would have much wider uncertainty bands. Such information is valuable for investment risk assessment and policy support.

## Conclusion

This study developed a comprehensive probabilistic framework to assess renewable hydrogen production across five U.S. regions, capturing the inherent uncertainty in resource-driven energy systems. We characterized solar and wind inputs with appropriate probability distributions (Beta, Weibull, etc.)​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/6/2241#:~:text=match%20at%20L743%20In%20the,the%20change%20in%20irradiance%20behaviour)​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/6/2241#:~:text=match%20at%20L759%20Electric%20Vehicles,Outcomes%20of%20the%20work) reflecting each region’s climate and variability, and propagated these through hourly models of PV/wind output to annual hydrogen yields using Monte Carlo simulation. By comparing distributed vs. centralized and standalone vs. grid-linked configurations, we identified how design and operation influence outcomes:

- **Resource Potential is Key:** Regions with superior renewable resources (solar in the Southwest, wind in the Great Plains and offshore) can achieve much higher hydrogen outputs and lower costs. For example, Arizona and the Great Plains can support >2× the hydrogen production of a Northeast region per unit capacity, leading to substantially lower LCOH. This highlights the benefit of locating hydrogen production where the energy is cheapest (and transmitting hydrogen or using carriers to deliver it), as opposed to producing it in low-resource areas unless necessary for end-use proximity.
    
- **Uncertainty and Reliability:** The stochastic approach shows that standalone renewable hydrogen has moderate output uncertainty (±10% or more year to year), which could impact revenue and project sizing. However, combining resources (solar + wind) and/or connecting to the grid can mitigate this. A mix of solar and wind smooths out seasonal and diurnal swings, providing a more stable hydrogen output – an important consideration for designing **“24/7” hydrogen hubs**. Grid connectivity virtually eliminates weather-related risk at the cost of introducing grid dependency. If firm hydrogen delivery is required, grid backup or storage is needed; otherwise, to claim completely green hydrogen, one must oversize renewables or accept intermittent production.
    
- **System Scale and Economics:** Centralized hydrogen production was found to be more favorable economically, due to higher efficiency and lower unit costs. Distributed systems have niche applications (e.g. remote refueling stations powered by on-site solar), but their hydrogen tends to be pricier. Nonetheless, distributed systems could avoid transport costs and use otherwise unused space (rooftops), which has value beyond our cost-per-kg metric. The choice may come down to specific use-cases and whether the priority is lowest cost or on-site generation.
    
- **Sensitivity and Optimization:** Our Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis underlines that improving capacity factor (through site selection or adding a complementary resource) is the most impactful lever to reduce hydrogen cost. Efforts such as tracking for PV, taller towers for wind, or simply building in the best locations, yield outsized benefits. Conversely, moderate changes in system losses or electrolyzer efficiency have relatively smaller effects. This suggests that at the current state of technology, **resource optimization beats incremental tech improvements** for near-term project viability. In the longer run, if electrolyzer costs fall dramatically or efficiencies improve (as per DOE targets of <43 kWh/kg, ~77% eff. by 2030​[energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/technical-targets-proton-exchange-membrane-electrolysis#:~:text=Technical%20Targets%20for%20Proton%20Exchange,Average%20Degradation%20Rate)), the balance may shift, but even then a high capacity factor will multiply those improvements.
    

In conclusion, each region offers unique prospects: the Texas Gulf Coast can leverage both high renewables and existing H₂ infrastructure to become a green hydrogen hub; the Great Plains can produce very low-cost hydrogen but will need delivery pipelines to markets; California and Arizona can generate huge solar-based hydrogen, especially if paired with storage or import of off-peak power to cover nights; New York can tap offshore wind for green hydrogen to decarbonize its urban demand, though at a higher cost that might be justified by local environmental goals. The probabilistic framework presented here provides a template for evaluating such projects under uncertainty, enabling smarter planning. By quantifying the likelihood of various outcomes (best-case vs. worst-case production, etc.), stakeholders can make risk-informed decisions on capacity sizing, hybridization, and contractual agreements (for example, how much firm hydrogen supply can be guaranteed from a given installation). Future work can extend this model to include financial risk (e.g. fluctuating electricity prices in grid-connected mode, or policy incentives like production tax credits) and to explore the impact of emerging solutions like seasonal hydrogen storage or dynamic operation (load following, grid services) on the overall economics.

Ultimately, our analysis reinforces that “location, location, location” is paramount for green hydrogen: investing in regions with strong and complementary renewable resources and designing systems to maximize utilization are critical to producing hydrogen at scale, reliably, and at competitive cost in a world with uncertain sun and wind.

3. Statistical Modeling of Renewable Energy Resources:

- 3.1. Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs):
    

- 3.1.1. Solar Irradiance:  
    To model the hourly and daily variability of solar irradiance, the Beta distribution is frequently employed in solar resource assessments due to its ability to fit data that is bounded between 0 and a maximum value, which in this context represents the clear sky irradiance. The general form of the Beta probability density function is given by:  
    f(x; α, β) = (x^(α-1) * (1-x)^(β-1)) / B(α, β) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1  
    where 'x' represents the clearness index (the ratio of measured irradiance to the clear sky irradiance), and α and β are the shape parameters that determine the shape of the distribution. B(α, β) is the Beta function, a normalization constant. For this application, the raw solar irradiance data obtained from sources like NSRDB and SURFRAD will likely need to be transformed into a clearness index by normalizing it with the clear sky irradiance for the specific time and location. Clear sky models, as mentioned in 47, can be utilized for this normalization process.  
    While the Beta distribution is well-suited for modeling short-term irradiance variability, for yearly variations or under specific circumstances where the data exhibits different patterns, the Normal or Log-normal distributions might also be considered. The Normal probability density function is:  
    f(x; μ, σ) = (1 / (σ * sqrt(2π))) * exp(-((x - μ)^2) / (2 * σ^2))  
    where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the data. The Log-normal distribution is applicable when the logarithm of the variable follows a normal distribution, often used for variables that are always positive and have a skewed distribution.
    
- 3.1.2. Wind Speed:  
    The Weibull distribution is a widely accepted statistical model for representing wind speed distributions due to its flexibility in fitting various wind regimes. The two-parameter Weibull probability density function is:  
    f(v; k, λ) = (k / λ) * (v / λ)^(k-1) * exp(- (v / λ)^k) for v ≥ 0  
    where 'v' is the wind speed, 'k' is the dimensionless shape parameter, which is indicative of the variability of the wind speed (a lower value suggests higher variability), and 'λ' is the scale parameter, which is related to the average wind speed.
    

- 3.2. Parameter Determination:  
    For each of the chosen probability distribution functions, the key parameters will be determined using the historical hourly and yearly solar irradiance and wind speed data collected for State College, Pennsylvania. Statistical methods such as the Method of Moments or Maximum Likelihood Estimation will be employed to estimate these parameters. The Method of Moments involves matching the sample moments (e.g., mean, variance) of the historical data with the theoretical moments of the chosen distribution to solve for the parameters. Maximum Likelihood Estimation, on the other hand, aims to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the given historical data.  
    For the Weibull distribution used to model wind speed, the shape parameter 'k' and the scale parameter 'λ' will be estimated from the collected wind speed data. A lower value of 'k' will indicate a higher degree of variability in the wind speeds. Similarly, for the Beta distribution used for solar irradiance, the shape parameters 'α' and 'β' will be estimated from the calculated clearness index data. For cases where Normal or Log-normal distributions are deemed appropriate for modeling solar irradiance, their respective parameters, the mean (μ) and the variance (σ²), will be directly estimated from the historical irradiance datasets.  
    It is important to note that the parameter estimation process will be carried out separately for hourly and yearly data for both solar irradiance and wind speed. This is necessary to capture the distinct characteristics of variability that occur at these different temporal scales. The hourly analysis will focus on the short-term fluctuations relevant to electrolyser operation, while the yearly analysis will provide insights into the long-term resource availability and potential inter-annual variations. The accuracy of the estimated parameters is critical for the reliability of the subsequent power generation simulations. To ensure the chosen PDFs and the estimated parameters adequately represent the historical data, goodness-of-fit tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or the Chi-squared test, will be performed. These tests will statistically assess how well the theoretical distributions fit the empirical distributions of the historical data. If the chosen PDFs do not provide a good fit, alternative distributions or parameter estimation methods may need to be considered to ensure the simulations accurately reflect the real-world behavior of the renewable energy resources in State College.
    

4. Power Generation Modeling:

- 4.1. Photovoltaic (PV) System Model:  
    The power output of a photovoltaic (PV) system is dependent on several factors, including the incident solar irradiance, the area and efficiency of the PV array, temperature effects on the module performance, and various system losses. A general equation to model the power output of a PV system (P_PV) is:  
    P_PV = G * A_PV * η_PV * (1 - β_T * (T_c - T_ref)) * DF  
    Where:
    

- G represents the solar irradiance incident on the PV array, measured in Watts per square meter (W/m²). This data will be obtained from the historical datasets and potentially converted to account for the tilt and orientation of the PV array.
    
- A_PV is the total area of the PV array in square meters (m²). This parameter will be a design variable that can be adjusted to achieve different capacity factors for the PV system.
    
- η_PV is the nominal efficiency of the PV modules at standard test conditions (STC), expressed as a percentage (%). This value will be based on the specifications of the PV technology chosen for the model.
    
- β_T is the temperature coefficient of power, typically given in percentage per degree Celsius (%/°C). It quantifies the decrease in the PV module's efficiency as its temperature increases.
    
- T_c is the operating temperature of the PV cells in degrees Celsius (°C).
    
- T_ref is the reference temperature at which the nominal efficiency is rated, usually 25°C.
    
- DF is the derating factor, a dimensionless value (typically between 0 and 1 or expressed as a percentage), which accounts for various system losses such as soiling, shading, wiring losses, inverter inefficiency, and other factors that reduce the overall power output.
    

The temperature of the PV cells (T_c) is not directly measured in typical meteorological datasets and needs to be estimated. A common simplified model for estimating cell temperature considers the ambient temperature (T_a), the incident solar irradiance (G), and the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT), which is a characteristic provided by the PV module manufacturer:T_c = T_a + (NOCT - 20) / 800 * GIn this equation, NOCT is given in °C, and the constant 800 represents a reference irradiance level in W/m². More complex models might also incorporate the effect of wind speed on cooling the PV modules.Key parameters that need to be determined or assumed for the PV model include the PV module efficiency (η_PV), the temperature coefficient (β_T), the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT) for the selected module technology, and an appropriate derating factor (DF). The area of the PV array (A_PV) will be a design parameter that will be varied to study the effect of different capacity factors on the hydrogen production system. For accurate power output estimation, it is crucial to account for the angle of incidence of solar radiation on the PV array. Since solar irradiance data is often provided for a horizontal surface, conversion models or the use of data specifically for tilted surfaces (if available from sources like the NSRDB 1) will be necessary to reflect the actual energy captured by the tilted PV panels.

- 4.2. Wind Turbine Model:  
    The power output of a wind turbine is primarily determined by the wind speed, air density, the size of the rotor, and the turbine's efficiency in converting wind energy into electrical energy. A general equation to model the power output of a wind turbine (P_Wind) is:  
    P_Wind = 0.5 * ρ * A_R * C_p(v, β) * v^3 * η_g  
    Where:
    

- ρ is the air density in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). Air density is influenced by factors such as temperature and altitude.
    
- A_R is the rotor swept area in square meters (m²), which is calculated from the rotor diameter (D_R) using the formula A_R = π * (D_R / 2)^2. The rotor diameter will be a key parameter influencing the turbine's capacity factor.
    
- C_p(v, β) is the power coefficient, a dimensionless value between 0 and approximately 0.59 (the Betz limit). It represents the efficiency of the turbine in converting the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy and is a function of the wind speed (v) and the blade pitch angle (β). This relationship is typically provided by the turbine manufacturer in the form of a power curve.
    
- v is the wind speed at the hub height of the turbine, measured in meters per second (m/s). Wind speed data from meteorological sources might need to be adjusted to the specific hub height of the chosen turbine using a wind shear profile.
    
- η_g is the overall efficiency of the generator and gearbox, expressed as a percentage (%). It accounts for the losses in the mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion process.
    

The air density (ρ) can be estimated using the ideal gas law:ρ = P / (R * T_a)Where P is the atmospheric pressure in Pascals (Pa), R is the specific gas constant for dry air (approximately 287.05 J/kg·K), and T_a is the ambient temperature in Kelvin (K).Key parameters for the wind turbine model include the rotor diameter (which determines A_R), the power curve that describes how the power coefficient C_p varies with wind speed (v), the hub height of the turbine (as wind speed typically increases with height), and the overall efficiency of the generator and gearbox (η_g). Similar to PV systems, wind turbines may also have derating factors, although these are often less significant. For accurate power output modeling, obtaining the specific power curve (C_p vs. v) for the chosen wind turbine model is essential. Generic power curves might not accurately reflect the performance characteristics of a particular turbine, leading to inaccuracies in the simulated energy production. Manufacturer datasheets or databases of wind turbine specifications will be consulted to obtain this crucial information.

5. Simulation of Hybrid PV-Wind Power Output:

To simulate the hourly power output of the hybrid PV-wind system, the determined probability distribution functions (PDFs) for hourly solar irradiance and wind speed will be utilized to generate synthetic time series of these resources for a representative year. This will involve drawing random numbers from the respective distributions. These simulated hourly values of solar irradiance and wind speed will then be fed into the power generation models developed for the PV system and the wind turbine in Section 4.

To investigate the impact of different capacity factors, the size of the PV system (represented by the area A_PV) and the wind turbine (related to the rotor swept area A_R) will be scaled. This scaling will allow for the analysis of various hybrid system configurations, ranging from systems dominated by one energy source to more balanced combinations. The total hourly power output of the hybrid system will be calculated as the sum of the power output from the PV system and the wind turbine at each hour.

The simulation process will be conducted for both hourly and yearly timescales. The hourly simulations will be crucial for analyzing the short-term variability of the combined power output and its implications for the PEM electrolyser's operation. The yearly simulations will provide insights into the total energy production from each source and the hybrid system over a longer period, which is essential for calculating capacity factors and conducting the techno-economic analysis.

It is important to consider potential temporal correlations between solar irradiance and wind speed in the simulation. While these resources are often treated as independent in simplified models, there might be some degree of correlation in reality. For instance, cloudy days with low solar irradiance might also be less windy, or vice versa. If such correlations are identified from the historical data analysis (Section 6), they should be incorporated into the simulation process. This can be achieved using statistical methods like copulas, which allow for the generation of correlated random variables with specified marginal distributions. Incorporating these correlations will lead to more realistic simulations of the hybrid system's power output variability. Ignoring potential correlations could result in an inaccurate representation of the system's performance and reliability. For example, if both solar and wind resources tend to be low simultaneously, assuming independence could overestimate the system's ability to provide a consistent power supply.

6. Analysis of Combined Capacity Factors and Complementarity:

The capacity factor for each individual energy source (PV and wind) and for the combined hybrid system will be calculated to assess their performance. The capacity factor is defined as the ratio of the actual energy produced by the system over a specific period (typically a year) to the theoretical maximum energy that could have been produced if the system operated at its rated power continuously over the same period. This metric provides a standardized way to compare the utilization of different energy generation technologies.

To quantify the complementary trade-offs between the PV and wind energy sources, statistical methods, particularly correlation analysis, will be employed. The hourly time series of solar irradiance and wind speed, as well as their respective power outputs, will be analyzed to determine the degree of correlation between them. A negative correlation would indicate a complementary relationship, suggesting that when one resource is abundant, the other tends to be less so, which can lead to a more stable combined power output. The strength and direction of this correlation will be a key factor in evaluating the benefits of a hybrid system.

Time-series analysis techniques will also be used to assess the potential for the hybrid system to smooth the power supply to the electrolyser compared to relying on a single energy source. By examining the variability of the combined power output over time, using metrics such as the standard deviation of the power output, the smoothing effect can be quantified. A lower standard deviation in the combined output compared to the individual outputs would indicate a more stable power supply.

Further insights into the complementarity of the resources can be gained by analyzing the cross-correlation function between the hourly time series of solar and wind power output. This analysis can reveal potential time lags in their relationship. For example, if wind speeds in the State College area tend to peak a few hours after sunset, when solar power generation drops to zero, this temporal dynamic would represent a valuable complementary characteristic. Understanding such time-dependent relationships can inform the design of the energy management system for the hydrogen production facility, potentially optimizing the operation of the electrolyser and reducing the need for extensive energy storage solutions to buffer the variability.

7. Techno-Economic Analysis:

7.1. Capital Costs:  
A critical component of this research plan is a thorough techno-economic analysis, which begins with a detailed investigation into the capital costs of the key system components: PV systems, wind turbines, and PEM electrolysers. This research will involve gathering cost data from a variety of sources, including reports and databases published by NREL (such as the Annual Technology Baseline), industry reports from organizations like the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and the American Clean Power Association (ACP), manufacturer quotes and datasheets for equipment of various capacities, and relevant academic literature and market research studies.  
It is well-established that the cost per unit of capacity for renewable energy technologies often decreases as the size of the system increases, a phenomenon known as cost scaling. This research will investigate these cost scaling effects for PV systems, wind turbines, and PEM electrolysers to develop appropriate cost functions that reflect the economies of scale. These functions will be crucial for estimating the capital costs of systems with different capacity factors.  
The total capital cost of the proposed hydrogen production system will encompass not only the costs of the renewable energy generation equipment (PV modules and wind turbines) and the PEM electrolyser itself but also the costs associated with balance-of-system (BOS) components. For the PV system, this includes inverters, wiring, mounting structures, and potentially land costs. For the wind turbine, BOS costs include the foundation, tower, electrical connections, and also potentially land lease. For the PEM electrolyser, BOS costs involve power conditioning equipment, water purification systems, hydrogen storage, and compression if required.  
It is essential that the capital cost data used in this analysis are specific to the current market conditions and take into account any potential regional variations in costs and the availability of incentives or subsidies for renewable energy projects in Pennsylvania. Using outdated or generic cost data could lead to significant inaccuracies in the subsequent Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOE) calculations and a misrepresentation of the economic feasibility of the proposed system. Therefore, the cost data will be carefully vetted for its relevance to the timeframe and location of the study.**

8. PEM Electrolyser Performance Modeling:

The performance and efficiency of the PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyser, which will convert the electricity generated by the hybrid renewable energy system into hydrogen, will be modeled based on its electrochemical characteristics. These characteristics are typically described by the electrolyser's polarization curve, which plots the operating voltage against the current density, and its efficiency curve, which shows how the energy efficiency of hydrogen production varies with the operating load. This information is usually provided by the electrolyser manufacturer.

The model will take the simulated hourly power input from the combined PV-wind system (as determined in Section 5) as the primary input. For each hour, the model will calculate the corresponding hydrogen production rate by considering the electrolyser's operating voltage and current. The relationship between power, voltage, and current (P = V * I) will be fundamental to this calculation.

It is crucial to incorporate the minimum and maximum operating power constraints of the PEM electrolyser into the model. Real electrolysers have a certain minimum power level below which they cannot operate effectively or safely, and a maximum power level beyond which they should not be operated to avoid damage. If the simulated power input from the renewable energy system falls outside these operating limits at any given hour, the model will reflect that no hydrogen production occurs during that time.

The efficiency of the electrolyser is not constant across its operating range. Typically, the energy efficiency of a PEM electrolyser (defined as the ratio of the energy content of the produced hydrogen to the electrical energy input) increases with increasing operating current density or power input, up to a certain point. This efficiency characteristic will be modeled as a function of the operating current density or the power input, using data or empirical relationships derived from manufacturer specifications or literature. Assuming a constant efficiency regardless of the load will lead to inaccuracies in the overall system performance assessment.

Furthermore, the model should consider the potential impact of the intermittent power supply from the renewable sources on the lifespan and degradation rate of the PEM electrolyser. Frequent start-stop cycles, rapid fluctuations in power input, or prolonged operation at very low loads might accelerate the degradation of the electrolyser components, particularly the stack. Increased degradation can lead to a shorter lifespan and higher long-term costs due to more frequent replacements, which will ultimately affect the LCOE of hydrogen production. While a detailed electrochemical degradation model might be beyond the scope of this initial research plan, consulting literature on electrolyser degradation under variable renewable power input will be important to understand the potential magnitude of this effect and to inform future research directions.

9. Sensitivity Analysis using Monte Carlo Simulations:

To comprehensively assess the uncertainties associated with the proposed hydrogen production system, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using Monte Carlo simulations. This statistical method involves running a large number of simulations (iterations), where in each iteration, the input parameters are randomly sampled from their respective probability distributions. This allows for the evaluation of how the variability in input parameters translates to variability in the output variables of interest, such as hydrogen production and the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOE).

In this analysis, random samples will be drawn from the probability distribution functions (PDFs) determined for hourly solar irradiance and wind speed in Section 3. This will capture the inherent variability of the renewable energy resources. A large number of iterations (e.g., 10,000) will be used to ensure a robust statistical representation of the potential outcomes.

Beyond the resource variability, uncertainties in various system-wide parameters will also be considered. These parameters might include the efficiency of the PV modules, the power coefficient of the wind turbine (which can vary with different wind conditions and turbine models), the efficiency of the PEM electrolyser, the capital costs of all the system components, the operational and maintenance (O&M) costs, and the discount rate used in the LCOE calculation. For each of these parameters, appropriate probability distributions will be defined based on available literature, manufacturer specifications, historical data (where applicable), or expert judgment. In each iteration of the Monte Carlo simulation, a random value for each of these uncertain parameters will be drawn from its defined distribution.

If a significant correlation between wind and solar resources is identified in Section 5, this correlation will be incorporated into the sampling process to ensure that the simulated resource values are statistically realistic. This might involve using copulas or other techniques for generating correlated random variables.

For each iteration of the Monte Carlo simulation, the hourly power output of the hybrid system will be calculated using the randomly sampled resource values and system parameters. This power output will then be used to model the hydrogen production by the PEM electrolyser, and finally, the LCOE will be calculated based on the total costs and the total hydrogen produced over the project's lifetime, considering the randomly sampled cost parameters and discount rate.

The results of the Monte Carlo simulations will be analyzed to generate probability distributions for the total hydrogen production over the project lifetime and the resulting LCOE. This will provide a quantitative measure of the uncertainty associated with these key outputs. Confidence intervals, such as the 90% confidence interval, will be reported to indicate the range within which the hydrogen production and LCOE are likely to fall. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis will help identify the key parameters that have the most significant impact on the uncertainty of hydrogen production and LCOE. This information can be valuable for prioritizing future research efforts aimed at reducing these uncertainties or for focusing on improving the accuracy of the parameters that have the greatest influence on the system's performance and economics. For example, if the capital cost of the electrolyser is found to be a major driver of LCOE uncertainty, efforts could be directed towards exploring strategies for reducing this cost.
