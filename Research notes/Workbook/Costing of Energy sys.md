## Key Insights

- **Onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the lowest-cost sources of new electricity generation in the US**.
    
- LCOE ranges have tightened recently, but the lower end of costs has increased due to inflation and supply chain pressures[5](https://www.pv-tech.org/lcoe-ranges-tighten-lazard-latest-financial-report/)[2](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/average-solar-lcoe-increases-for-first-time-this-year/).
    
- Distributed and rooftop solar remain significantly more expensive than utility-scale projects, even when accounting for subsidies[2](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/average-solar-lcoe-increases-for-first-time-this-year/)[5](https://www.pv-tech.org/lcoe-ranges-tighten-lazard-latest-financial-report/).
    
- Offshore wind, especially floating platforms, remains much costlier than onshore wind and solar[1](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88335.pdf)[2](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/average-solar-lcoe-increases-for-first-time-this-year/).

## LCOE Ranges for Wind, Solar, and Grid Systems in the US

**Land-Based (Onshore) Wind**

- The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for onshore wind in the US currently ranges from **$27/MWh to $73/MWh**[5](https://www.pv-tech.org/lcoe-ranges-tighten-lazard-latest-financial-report/).
    
- Recent National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analysis for 2023 commissioned plants estimates a reference LCOE of **$42/MWh**, with a sensitivity range of **$30–$57/MWh** depending on variables like site quality and financing[4](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/91775.pdf)[1](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88335.pdf).
    
- Other sources, including Lazard and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), report similar ranges, with most recent figures clustering between **$24/MWh and $75/MWh**[2](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/average-solar-lcoe-increases-for-first-time-this-year/)[7](https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1824371/us-unsubsidised-onshore-wind-lcoe-jumps-nearly-40)[8](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf).
    

**Offshore Wind**

- The LCOE for offshore wind is higher, reflecting more complex installation and maintenance:
    
    - **Fixed-bottom offshore wind:** **$72–$140/MWh**[2](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/average-solar-lcoe-increases-for-first-time-this-year/)[7](https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1824371/us-unsubsidised-onshore-wind-lcoe-jumps-nearly-40).
        
    - NREL's 2023 estimate for a reference fixed-bottom project is **$95/MWh**, with a sensitivity range of **$52–$184/MWh**[1](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88335.pdf).
        
    - **Floating offshore wind** is even higher, with reference values around **$145/MWh** and a broad sensitivity range[1](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88335.pdf).
        

**Utility-Scale Solar PV**

- The LCOE for utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects in the US is currently **$29/MWh to $92/MWh**[5](https://www.pv-tech.org/lcoe-ranges-tighten-lazard-latest-financial-report/).
    
- Lazard's 2024 analysis confirms this, noting that solar remains among the cheapest sources of new power generation[5](https://www.pv-tech.org/lcoe-ranges-tighten-lazard-latest-financial-report/).
    
- Previous years saw slightly lower minimums (as low as $24/MWh), but recent inflation and supply chain issues have raised the lower end[2](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/average-solar-lcoe-increases-for-first-time-this-year/)[5](https://www.pv-tech.org/lcoe-ranges-tighten-lazard-latest-financial-report/).




When calculating the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for renewable energy systems, the **Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)**, project lifetime (**n**), and discount rate (**r**) are critical parameters. Here are typical ranges based on industry standards and financial assumptions:

## 1. **Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)**

- **Range:** **5–15%** (0.05–0.15)
- CRF increases with higher discount rates (**r**) and shorter project lifetimes (**n**).

## 2. **Project Lifetime (n)**

- **Wind turbines:** **20–25 years**
- **Solar PV systems:** **25–30 years**
- **Battery storage:** **10–15 years** (if included in the system)[6](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2022/equations_&_variables)[8](https://www.efchina.org/Attachments/Report/reports-efchina-20110128-en/Levelized%20Cost%20of%20Energy%20Calculation_BV_EN.pdf).

## 3. **Discount Rate (r)**

- **Public/government projects:** **3–5%** (reflecting low-risk financing).
- **Private projects:** **7–12%** (accounting for risk premiums and cost of capital).
- **High-risk ventures:** **10–15%**[4](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Discounting)[6](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2022/equations_&_variables)[8](https://www.efchina.org/Attachments/Report/reports-efchina-20110128-en/Levelized%20Cost%20of%20Energy%20Calculation_BV_EN.pdf).

## Key Relationships

|Parameter|Impact on LCOE|Typical Value Range|
|---|---|---|
|**CRF**|Higher CRF → Higher annualized capital costs|0.05–0.15|
|**n**|Longer lifetime → Lower LCOE|20–30 years (solar/wind)|
|**r**|Higher discount rate → Higher LCOE|3–12%|

## Operating Costs for PV, Solar, and Battery Systems

references for **operating costs** (OpEx) of photovoltaic (PV), solar, and battery energy storage systems (BESS), alongside capital costs, from leading institutions such as NREL and the U.S. Department of Energy.

**Utility-Scale PV and PV+Battery Systems (2024, NREL/DOE)**

| System Type           | Capital Cost (MMP, $/Wdc) | Operating Cost (OpEx, $/kWdc-yr) | LCOE ($/MWh) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Utility-Scale PV      | $1.12                     | $16–$20                          | $45–$55      |
| Utility-Scale PV+BESS | $1.99                     | $48                              | $94          |

- **Operating costs** for utility-scale PV+storage systems are estimated at **$48/kWdc-yr** as of Q1 2024[2](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks).
- These OpEx values include routine operations and maintenance (O&M), periodic equipment replacement (notably battery replacement, typically at year 15), insurance, and administrative costs[5](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_pv-plus-battery).
- The **LCOE** (levelized cost of energy) for utility-scale PV+storage is benchmarked at **$94/MWh** in 2024[2](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks).
    

**Residential PV and PV+Battery Systems (2024, NREL/DOE)**

|System Type|Capital Cost (MMP, $/Wdc)|Operating Cost (OpEx, $/kWdc-yr)|LCOE ($/MWh)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Residential PV|$3.15|$20–$25|$180–$200|
|Residential PV+BESS|$5.19|$70|$264|

- **Operating costs** for residential PV+storage systems are estimated at **$70/kWdc-yr**[2](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks).
- These costs cover O&M, monitoring, insurance, and routine battery maintenance/replacement.
- The **LCOE** for residential PV+storage is benchmarked at **$264/MWh** in 2024[2](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks).
    

**Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Operating Costs**

- For utility-scale stand-alone BESS, O&M costs are typically included within the PV+storage OpEx benchmarks above.
- NREL’s methodology includes battery cell replacement (usually at year 15) as part of the fixed O&M costs, along with inverter replacements and routine maintenance[5](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_pv-plus-battery).


**Cost Structure and O&M Details**

- O&M costs for PV and BESS systems include scheduled/unscheduled maintenance, inverter and battery replacement, insurance, administrative costs, and site services[5](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_pv-plus-battery)[6](https://www2.nrel.gov/solar/market-research-analysis/solar-system-operations-maintenance-analysis).
- For utility-scale systems, O&M costs are generally lower per kW than for residential systems, reflecting economies of scale.
- NREL and DOE benchmarks are widely referenced in academic literature and industry analysis for OpEx estimates[2](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks)[5](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_pv-plus-battery)[7](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/92257.pdf).
