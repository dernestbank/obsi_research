Wind turbine power generation can be predicted using the fundamental equation:
`Power output is related to the local air density, which is a function of altitude, pressure, and temperature. Dense air exerts more pressure on the rotors, which results in higher power output.`

**Power (W) = 0.5 × ρ × πr² × Cp × v³**  
where:
- **ρ** = Air density (typically 1.225 kg/m³ at sea level)[1](https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/wind-turbine)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)
- **r** = Rotor radius (meters)[1](https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/wind-turbine)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)
- **Cp** = Power coefficient (turbine efficiency, ≤ 59.3% per Betz's law)[1](https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/wind-turbine)[3](https://reads.alibaba.com/7-factors-that-impact-wind-turbine-efficiency/)
- **v** = Wind speed (m/s)[1](https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/wind-turbine)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)

`Turbines are designed to operate within a specific range of wind speeds. The limits of the range are known as the cut-in speed and cut-out speed.[5] The cut-in speed is the point at which the wind turbine is able to generate power. Between the cut-in speed and the rated speed, where the maximum output is reached, the power output will increase cubically with wind speed. `

## Key Dependencies

 1. **Wind Speed (v)**
- Power output increases **cubically** with wind speed (doubling wind speed increases power 8x)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)[8](https://energy-elege.com/wind-turbine-power-generation-efficiency/).
- Turbines operate between **cut-in** (3–4 m/s) and **cut-out** (25–30 m/s) speeds[5](https://www.landgate.com/news/how-weather-affects-wind-turbines-in-the-united-states)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power).
    
 2. **Air Density (ρ)**
- Depends on altitude, temperature, and pressure. Colder, denser air increases output[3](https://reads.alibaba.com/7-factors-that-impact-wind-turbine-efficiency/)[5](https://www.landgate.com/news/how-weather-affects-wind-turbines-in-the-united-states)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power).
    
 3. **Rotor Radius (r)**
- Larger blades capture more kinetic energy: **swept area (A = πr²)** is proportional to power[3](https://reads.alibaba.com/7-factors-that-impact-wind-turbine-efficiency/)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power)[8](https://energy-elege.com/wind-turbine-power-generation-efficiency/).
    
4. **Turbine Efficiency (Cp)**
- Combines aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical losses. Typical real-world efficiency: **30–40%**[1](https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/wind-turbine)[3](https://reads.alibaba.com/7-factors-that-impact-wind-turbine-efficiency/)[8](https://energy-elege.com/wind-turbine-power-generation-efficiency/).
    
- Includes wake effects, gearbox losses, and downtime[1](https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/wind-turbine)[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6686152/).
    
## Secondary Factors

- **Altitude/Hub Height**: Higher elevations reduce air density but increase wind speed due to reduced ground friction[3](https://reads.alibaba.com/7-factors-that-impact-wind-turbine-efficiency/)[5](https://www.landgate.com/news/how-weather-affects-wind-turbines-in-the-united-states).
- **Temperature**: Affects air density and component thermal expansion[3](https://reads.alibaba.com/7-factors-that-impact-wind-turbine-efficiency/)[5](https://www.landgate.com/news/how-weather-affects-wind-turbines-in-the-united-states).
- **Control Systems**: Pitch/yaw adjustments optimize blade angle for varying wind conditions[3](https://reads.alibaba.com/7-factors-that-impact-wind-turbine-efficiency/)[8](https://energy-elege.com/wind-turbine-power-generation-efficiency/).
- **Turbine Spacing**: Closely spaced turbines reduce efficiency due to wake effects[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6686152/)[7](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Wind_power).

## Mathematical Modeling of Wind Turbine Power Generation  

The mechanical power output of a wind turbine is governed by the **Betz-Lanchester equation**, derived from fluid dynamics principles[1][3][5]:  
$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3 C_p
$$
**Variables and Parameters**  
- $\rho$: Air density ($\text{kg/m}^3$)  
- $v$: Wind speed ($\text{m/s}$)  
- $C_p$: Power coefficient (dimensionless, ≤ 0.593 per Betz’s law)  

---

### Core Theoretical Derivations  

#### 1. **Actuator Disk Theory**  
The turbine is modeled as an actuator disk extracting kinetic energy from wind. Using mass and momentum conservation[5]:  
$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3 \cdot 4a(1-a)^2
$$
where $a$ = axial induction factor (ratio of downstream to upstream wind speed reduction). Maximum $C_p = \frac{16}{27} \approx 0.593$ occurs at $a = \frac{1}{3}$[5].  

#### 2. **Real-World Efficiency**  
Actual $C_p$ values (typically 0.3–0.45) account for:  
- Aerodynamic losses (blade tip vortices, drag)  
- Mechanical losses (gearbox, bearings)  
- Generator inefficiencies[3][7].  

---

### Operational Dependencies  

#### **Wind Speed Profile**  
Wind speed increases with hub height ($h$) due to reduced ground friction[1]:  The power law states:
$$
v(h) = v_0 \left( \frac{h}{h_0} \right)^{1/7}
$$
where $v_0$ = reference speed at height $h_0$.  
![[image-15.png]]

, `is the known wind speed at a reference height, normally ten meters, h is the desired height above ground level, m and is a terrain related coefficient.`

![[image-14.png]]

Leishman, J. G. (2006). Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics. New York: Cambridge University Press.

#### **Power Curve Characteristics**  
- **Cut-in speed** ($v_c$): Minimum speed for power generation (3–4 m/s).  
- **Rated speed** ($v_r$): Speed at maximum power output.  
- **Cut-out speed** ($v_f$): Safety shutdown threshold (25–30 m/s)[3].  

---

### Extended Model Formulations  

#### 1. **Annual Energy Yield**  
Integrate power over wind speed distribution (Weibull or Rayleigh)[1]:  
$$
E_{\text{annual}} = 8760 \cdot \int_{v_c}^{v_f} P(v) \cdot f(v) \, dv
$$  
where $f(v)$ = probability density function of wind speeds.  

#### 2. **Turbulence and Wake Effects**  
Adjacent turbines reduce efficiency due to turbulent wakes[5][7]:  
$$
P_{\text{eff}} = P \cdot (1 - \eta_{\text{wake}})
$$  
where $\eta_{\text{wake}}$ = wake loss factor (empirically derived).  

---

### Numerical Validation  

#### Case Study: 2.3 MW Turbine  
- $r = 50 \, \text{m}$, $v = 12 \, \text{m/s}$, $\rho = 1.225 \, \text{kg/m}^3$, $C_p = 0.35$  
$$
P = 0.5 \times 1.225 \times \pi \times 50^2 \times 0.35 \times 12^3 \approx 2.3 \, \text{MW}
$$
#### Comparison to Real-World Data  
| Parameter              | Theoretical | Real-World | Source |     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | --- |
| $$ C_p $$              | 0.593       | 0.35–0.45  | [3][5] |     |
| Annual capacity factor | 60%         | 25–50%     | [7]    |     |

---

### Implementation in Thesis Work  
1. **Model Calibration**: Use SCADA data to refine $C_p$ and turbulence parameters.  
2. **Height Optimization**: Solve $\frac{dC}{dh} = 0$ for cost-effective hub height[1].  
3. **Wake Modeling**: Incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for wind farm layouts[5][7].  
This framework provides a rigorous basis for analyzing turbine performance, site selection, and energy yield forecasting.

# Consolidated Analytical Expressions for Turbine Power Coefficient (Cp)

Below is a consolidated set of the most widely used analytical expressions for the turbine power coefficient, $C_p$, as functions of the **tip-speed ratio $\lambda$** (and, where noted, **blade pitch $\beta$).** 
 All equations and parameter values are drawn from Castillo et al.’s 2023 review .

## 1. Fundamental Definition

The instantaneous turbine power is
$$P_t = \tfrac12\,C_p(\lambda,\beta)\,\rho\,\pi r^2\,v_\omega^3$$
with
$$\lambda = \frac{r\,\omega_m}{v_\omega}$$
– Betz’s theoretical limit is $C_p \le 0.593$.

## 2. Polynomial Approximations

Often used for small‐scale emulators ($\lambda$-only dependence):

| Order | $C_p(\lambda)$                                                                | Blade radius & power | Source |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|
| 3rd   | $$-3.7 \times 10^{-5}\lambda^3 - 0.004834\lambda^2 + 0.1063\lambda - 0.02086$$ | 1.086 m, 3 kW      |        |
| 4th   | $$0.00044\lambda^4 - 0.012\lambda^3 + 0.097\lambda^2 - 0.2\lambda + 0.11$$    | 1.086 m, 3 kW      |        |
| 5th   | $$0.043 - 0.108\lambda + 0.146\lambda^2 - 0.0605\lambda^3 + 0.0104\lambda^4 - 0.0006\lambda^5$$ | 1.525 m, 2 kW      |        |
| 6th   | $$0.051 - 0.0022\lambda + 0.0052\lambda^2 -5.1425 \times 10^{-4}\lambda^3 -2.795 \times 10^{-5}\lambda^4 +4.6313 \times 10^{-6}\lambda^5 -1.331 \times 10^{-7}\lambda^6$$ | 2.5 m, 4.2 kW      |        |

## 3. Sinusoidal ($\lambda$, $\beta$) Models

Include pitch control ($\beta$ in °):

$$C_p(\lambda,\beta) = \Bigl[b_0 + b_1(\beta + b_2)\Bigr] \sin\!\Bigl[\frac{\pi(\lambda + b_3)}{b_4 + b_5(\beta + b_6)}\Bigr] + b_7(\lambda + b_8)(\beta + b_9)$$

| Model             | $[b_0…b_9]$                                 | Scale & source    |

## 4. Exponential ($\lambda$, $\beta$) Models

Common for utility‐scale ≥300 kW:

$$C_p(\lambda,\beta) = c_0\Bigl(\frac{c_1}{\lambda_i} - c_2\beta - c_3\beta^{p} - c_4\Bigr) e^{-\,c_7/\lambda_i\,+\,c_8\lambda}$$
with
$$\frac1{\lambda_i} = \frac1{\lambda + c_9\,\beta + c_{10}} - \frac{c_{11}}{1+\beta^3}$$

## 5. Picking Your Model & Plotting

- Small‐scale (< 10 kW): polynomial 3rd–5th order or sinusoidal (β control).
- MW‐scale: exponential models (e.g. Shi et al. for large turbines).
- Plot $C_p(\lambda)$ at $\beta$ = 0° for baseline, then overlay curves to compare $\lambda_{max}$ and $C_{p,max}$.
- A typical $C_p$ vs $\lambda$ curve peaks around $\lambda \approx 6–8$ with $C_{p,max} \approx 0.44–0.53$ for modern three-blade rotors .

, and I can help you generate the specific $C_p(\lambda,\beta)$ plot for that case.

## 4. modelling tips

Pick the family that matches your hardware & control philosophy:

- Fixed-pitch or stall-regulated → polynomial is adequate, simplest.
- Pitch-regulated, medium turbine → sinusoidal family (Xin curve is numerically well-behaved).
- Megawatt-scale, aggressive β control, or need Cp surface for dynamic programming → exponential (Shi or Ovando sets cover the usual λ window 4–10).

Stay within the validated λ window shown above to keep Cp physical (< Betz 0.593).
Couple Cp to your aero-elastic model to generate mechanical power Pt = ½ ρ A Cp(λ,β) v³, then feed generator–electrolyser chain.
For hydrogen yield optimisation, run a parametric sweep (λ,β) across your wind-speed distribution; then numerically maximise net-H₂ per swept m² while satisfying grid-or-battery constraints.
Torque coefficient if you need it: Ct = Cp / λ (from Betz momentum theory) – all curves above comply.

# The area required for a a unit MW power of a wind turbine

A single large wind turbine (in the MW range) typically requires **at least 1 acre (approximately 4000 square meters)** of property or more, considering the space around the tower and for maintenance access.

Modern onshore turbines today tend to have **specific‐power ratings** in the ballpark of **192–275 W/m²**, which you can translate into swept‐area‐per‐megawatt by dividing 1 MW (1 000 000 W) by that range:

  

\frac{1\,000\,000\;\mathrm{W}}{275\;\mathrm{W/m^2}} \;\approx\;3\,636\;\mathrm{m^2/MW} \quad\text{to}\quad \frac{1\,000\,000\;\mathrm{W}}{192\;\mathrm{W/m^2}} \;\approx\;5\,208\;\mathrm{m^2/MW}

  

If you look at actual turbine models—say the Nordex Gamma series (2.4–2.5 MW machines)—you get swept areas like 5 026 m² up to 10 751 m², which yields an average of about **2 974 m² per MW**:

| **Model**   | **Rated Power (MW)** | **Swept Area (m²)** | **m² per MW** |

### **What this means for scaling**

- **Rule of thumb:** assume **3 000 m² of rotor sweep per MW** of nameplate capacity.
    
- **To size A in your model:**
    
    $A_{\rm total} \;=\; 3\,000\;\bigl[\mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{MW}\bigr]\;\times\;P_{\rm rated}\;[\mathrm{MW}].$
    
- **Example:** for a 2 MW turbine, $A\approx$ 6\,000 m²; for a 5 MW machine, $A\approx$ 15\,000 m².
    

  


# Is the wind turbine power a function of a time of the day?

Yes, **wind power is a function of the time of day**. Wind speed-and therefore wind turbine power output-fluctuates throughout the day due to meteorological and atmospheric processes. Studies and operational data show that wind generation often exhibits distinct daily (diurnal) patterns, with output rising or falling at certain times depending on local climate, geography, and weather systems[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/8828093)[2](https://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/understanding-variable-output-characteristics-of-wind-power-variability-and-predictability.html)[3](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy99osti/26722.pdf)[5](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61714.pdf).

For example, research in China found that wind power output tends to be lower during daytime and higher at night in many regions, especially during heat waves[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/8828093). Analysis of wind farm data in the U.S. shows that wind generation is more likely to increase in the morning and decrease in the afternoon, reflecting typical daily wind patterns[3](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy99osti/26722.pdf). Aggregated data from many wind farms also reveals clear cycles, with peaks in variability and output often occurring around sunrise and sunset, linked to atmospheric boundary layer changes[5](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61714.pdf).

In summary, while the exact pattern depends on location and season, **wind power output generally varies with the time of day** due to natural changes in wind speed and atmospheric conditions[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/8828093)[2](https://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/understanding-variable-output-characteristics-of-wind-power-variability-and-predictability.html)[3](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy99osti/26722.pdf)[5](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61714.pdf).

To capture both **seasonal** and **diurnal** cycles in your Weibull‐based wind model, we **modulate the scale parameter** (λ) itself with simple sine‐based factors before you sample your wind speed.  

---

### **1. Define two modulation factors**

1. **Seasonal factor**
    
    $$S_{\rm season} = 1 + A_s \;\sin\!\Bigl(\frac{\text{DayOfYear}-\phi_s}{365}\;2\pi\Bigr)$$
    
    - $A_s$ = seasonal amplitude
    - $\phi_s$= phase shift so peak season (e.g. winter or spring) aligns with real data
        
    
2. **Diurnal factor**
    $$S_{\rm diurnal} = 1 + A_d \;\sin\!\Bigl(\frac{\text{HourOfDay}-\phi_d}{24}\;2\pi\Bigr)$$
    
    - $A_d$ = diurnal amplitude (e.g. 0.1 for ±10% rise/fall around daily mean)
    - $\phi_d$ = shift so peak wind time (e.g. early morning) lands on the right hour

 # Dynamic Wind Velocity Model with Diurnal and Seasonal Modulation Factors (Equations & References)

To model dynamic wind velocity with diurnal and seasonal modulation factors, researchers often adjust the parameters of wind speed probability distributions (e.g., Weibull) using time-dependent functions. Below are equations and key references from the literature supporting this approach.

## 1. Weibull Distribution with Modulated Scale Parameter

Wind speed $v$ is commonly modeled using the Weibull distribution:

$$f(v) = \frac{k}{\lambda} \left( \frac{v}{\lambda} \right)^{k-1} e^{-\left( \frac{v}{\lambda} \right)^k}$$

where:

- $k$: Shape parameter (turbulence intensity)
- $\lambda$: Scale parameter (related to mean wind speed)

To capture seasonal and diurnal cycles, the scale parameter $\lambda$ is modulated as follows:

## 2. Modulation Equations

### Seasonal Factor ([He et al., 2010]; [Monahan et al., 2011]):

$$\lambda_{\text{season}}(t) = \lambda_{\text{base}} \left[ 1 + A_s \sin\left( \frac{2\pi (\text{DayOfYear} - \phi_s)}{365} \right) \right]$$

### Diurnal Factor ([Spatiotemporal Diurnal Modulation, 2022]):

$$\lambda_{\text{diurnal}}(t) = \lambda_{\text{base}} \left[ 1 + A_d \sin\left( \frac{2\pi (\text{HourOfDay} - \phi_d)}{24} \right) \right]$$

### Combined Effective Scale Parameter:

$$\lambda_{\text{eff}}(t) = \lambda_{\text{base}} \cdot \lambda_{\text{season}}(t) \cdot \lambda_{\text{diurnal}}(t)$$

**Parameters:**

- $A_s, A_d$: Seasonal/diurnal amplitude (e.g., $A_s = 0.2$ for a 20% seasonal swing)
- $\phi_s, \phi_d$: Phase shifts aligning peaks (e.g., $\phi_s = 80$ for winter maxima)
- $\lambda_{\text{base}}$: Baseline scale parameter (site-specific)

## 3. Dynamic Wind Speed Generation

Using the modulated $\lambda_{\text{eff}}(t)$, hourly wind speeds are sampled via inverse transform:

$$v(t) = \lambda_{\text{eff}}(t) \cdot \left[ -\ln(1 - U) \right]^{1/k}, \quad U \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$$

## 4. Key Literature Support

- **Diurnal Modulation of Turbulence ([PMC, 2022]):** [[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989510/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989510/)]
  - Demonstrated that wind speed variance and power fluctuation rates exhibit sinusoidal diurnal patterns, peaking midday.
  - Proposed time-varying models to reduce uncertainty in wind power forecasts.
  - Equation (6) in the study defines wind power variation rate $\chi_p$, aligning with sine-based modulation.

- **Seasonal Weibull Parameter Variation ([AMS, 2012]):** [[https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/25/18/jcli-d-11-00321.1.xml](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/25/18/jcli-d-11-00321.1.xml)]
  - Showed that the Weibull distribution underestimates nighttime wind speed skewness, necessitating time-dependent parameter adjustments.
  - Observed seasonal shifts in wind speed probability density functions (PDFs) due to boundary layer dynamics.

- **Hybrid Measured/Simulated Data ([CMU, 2010]):** [[https://www.cmu.edu/ceic/assets/docs/publications/working-papers/ceic-10-03.pdf](https://www.cmu.edu/ceic/assets/docs/publications/working-papers/ceic-10-03.pdf)]
  - Combined measured low-frequency data (for diurnal/seasonal trends) with simulated turbulence, validating the use of modulation factors to replicate non-stationary wind behavior.

- **Boundary Layer Influence ([Monahan et al., 2011]):** [[https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/24/15/2011jcli4106.1.xml](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/24/15/2011jcli4106.1.xml)]
  - Linked diurnal wind PDF changes to nocturnal boundary layer processes, supporting the need for dynamic $\lambda$ in models.

## 5. Summary Table

| Factor       | Modulation Equation | Key Reference     |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Seasonal** | λseason(t)          | [He et al., 2010] |
| **Diurnal**  | λdiurnal(t)         | [PMC, 2022]       |
| **Combined** | λeff(t)             | [CMU, 2010]       |

The equations above provide a robust framework for modeling wind velocity with diurnal and seasonal modulation. By adjusting the Weibull scale parameter using sinusoidal factors, this approach aligns with observed atmospheric dynamics and hybrid simulation methods in the literature.

### **2. Compute an**  **effective** **Weibull scale**

Combine them multiplicatively:

```
λ_eff = λ_base
      * S_season
      * S_diurnal
```

So in Excel, assuming:

- lambda in cell X1
- A_season in X2
- phi_season in X3
- $A_{diurnal}$ in X4
- phi_diurnal in X5
- C2 = DayOfYear
- B2 = HourOfDay
    
you’d write:

```
= $X$1
  * (1 + $X$2 * SIN((C2 - $X$3)/365 * 2*PI()))
  * (1 + $X$4 * SIN((B2 - $X$5)/24  * 2*PI()))
```


---

### **3. Draw your hourly wind speed**

Use that λ_eff in your inverse‐transform:

```
v_wind = λ_eff * ( -LN( RAND() ) ) ^ (1/k)
```

with your existing shape parameter k.

---

### **4. Compute power as before**  

Feed v_wind into your Pₚₕᵧₛ = ½ρACₚv³ curve, normalize at rated speed, clamp by cut‐in/rated/cut‐out, etc.

---

## **Why this works**

- **Seasonal sine** captures slower month‐to‐month shifts (e.g. stronger winter winds).
- **Diurnal sine** overlays your morning-peak / afternoon-dip pattern.
- **Multiplying** both onto λ shifts the entire Weibull distribution moment-by-moment.
    
By tuning $A_s, A_d, \phi_s$, and $\phi_d$ to match measured data for each U.S. region, you’ll get a wind model that rises and falls both by **season** and by **time of day**, exactly as observed in operational wind farms.


|**Name (range or cell)**|**Value**|**Units**|**What it does**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**λ_base**|7.0|m/s|Base Weibull scale (e.g. Texas Gulf Coast)|
|**k_shape**|2.0|–|Weibull shape|
|**A_season**|0.20|–|±20 % seasonal swing|
|**φ_season**|355|day of year|Peak-of-year (Dec 21≈355) for winter winds|
|**A_diurnal**|0.15|–|±15 % daily swing|
|**φ_diurnal**|6|hour|Peak wind around 6 AM|

  

---

### **How to use in your Excel formula**

1. Define these as named cells (or put them in, say, **X1:X6**).
    
2. Then your **effective scale** becomes:
    

```
= λ_base
  * (1 + A_season * SIN((DayOfYear - φ_season)/365 * 2*PI()))
  * (1 + A_diurnal * SIN((HourOfDay  - φ_diurnal)/24  * 2*PI()))
```

2.   
    
3. Finally draw your wind speed:
    

```
= λ_eff * ( -LN(RAND()) ) ^ (1/k_shape)
```


With those numbers you’ll get roughly ±20 % slower winds in midsummer versus midwinter, and a ±15 % bump each morning around 6 AM—values you can further tune to match any specific U.S. location.


### **1. Choose  rating and key wind speeds**

- $P_{\rm rated}$(e.g. 2 MW)
    
- $v_{\rm cut-in}$ (e.g. 3 m/s) – below this there’s no output
    
- $v_{\rm rated}$ (e.g. 12 m/s) – at and above this (up to cut-out) you hit full rated power
    
- $v_{\rm cut-out}$ (e.g. 25 m/s) – above this you shut down for safety



Then limit that fraction between 0 and 1, and multiply by P_{\rm rated}

```excel
=IF(
   v < v_cut_in, 
   0,
   IF(
     v <= v_rated,
     P_rated * ( P_phys(v) / P_phys(v_rated) ),
     IF(
       v <= v_cut_out,
       P_rated,
       0
     )
   )
 )
```

```excel
P_frac(v) = P_phys(v) / P_phys(v_rated)
P_clamped(v) = IF(
   v < v_cut_in, 0,
   IF(v <= v_rated,
      P_rated * P_frac(v),
      IF(v <= v_cut_out, P_rated, 0)
   )
)
```


- - Or treat your farm as a single 50 MW “big turbine” by setting
        $$P_{\rm rated} = 50\text{ MW}, \quad P_{\rm phys}(v_{\rm rated}) = 0.5ρAC_p\,v_{\rm rated}^3$$
for 1m/s

## **Parameter choices (λ, k, Cₚ, ρ)**

- **Scale λ too low** (e.g. using 6 m/s instead of 7 m/s) → lower mean v³ → lower CF
- **Shape k too high** (e.g. 2.5 instead of 2) → distribution more peaked → lower average v³
- **Cₚ** (power coefficient) often peaks at 0.45 in lab, but real turbines average ~0.30–0.35
- **Air density ρ** can vary (1.2–1.3 kg/m³); using a smaller ρ reduces power
    

  

**Action:** compare your chosen λ, k, Cₚ, ρ against manufacturer or meteorological site data




> [!question] 
> is a dynamic cp same as a dynamic velocity 

no.
### What “Dynamic Cp” Means (in literature):

In contrast, **“Dynamic Cp”** refers to:

- Transient behavior of Cp​ **during turbine acceleration/deceleration**.
- Non-steady aerodynamic responses (e.g., **dynamic stall**, turbulence effects).
- Situations where

- $Cp​(t)=! Cp​(λ(t),β(t))$
    because of **inertia, rotor lag, or turbulence**.
    

This is modeled with:
- **Blade Element Momentum (BEM)** with unsteady corrections.
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** or
- Experimental lookup tables.

From Astrani et al
as defined in Ref. [41],
When v lies from vc to vr, with the assumption that ρ, A, and Cp are constant values, then the output power of the wind turbine as a function of v is defined in (10) [42]
the output power of the wind turbines, the wind speed data will be adjusted based on the hub height of each wind turbine as defined in (13) [43].

Additional context:

- Feathering below the cut-in speed prevents rotor spinning to protect wildlife, as noted in a 2024 study on curtailment strategies[2](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2688-8319.12371).
    
- Cut-in speed increases are sometimes used to reduce bat fatalities, with studies showing conventional cut-in speeds around 3.5 m/s and increased cut-in speeds up to 6.5 m/s for wildlife protection[3](https://www.conservationevidence.com/actions/1960).
    
- The Power Curve Working Group (PCWG) defines normalized wind speeds where 0 corresponds to cut-in and 1 to rated wind speed, emphasizing the importance of these parameters in power curve modeling[4](https://wes.copernicus.org/preprints/wes-2019-69/wes-2019-69-AC1-supplement.pdf).

of bats are killed by turbines each year, raising concerns about the impacts ofwind energy expansion on bat populations. Preventing turbine blades from spin-ning at low wind speeds, referred to as curtailment, is a method to reduce batfatalities,
curtailment reduced total bat fatalities by 33% with every 1.0 ms−1increase in curtailment wind speed. Estimates of the efficacy for the three targetspecies were similar (hoary bats: 28% per ms−1 , 95% CI: 0.4%–48%, eastern redbats: 32% per ms−1 , 95% CI: 13%–47% and silver-haired bats: 32% per ms−1 , 95%CI: 3%–53%).4. Across multiple facilities and years, a 5.0 ms−1 cut-in speed was estimated to re-duce total bat fatalities by an average of 62% (95% CI: 54%–69%)
