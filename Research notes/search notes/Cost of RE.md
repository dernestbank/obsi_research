Cost Analysis of Renewable Energy Systems: Wind and Solar PV

## **Capital Costs**

#### Wind Energy

- **Onshore Wind Turbines**: The capital cost is approximately $1.3 million per megawatt (MW). For a typical 2-3 MW turbine, this amounts to $2.6–$4 million per turbine. Offshore turbines can cost significantly more due to their larger size and installation complexity, ranging up to $18 million for 16-18 MW turbines[1](https://weatherguardwind.com/how-much-does-wind-turbine-cost-worth-it/)[5](https://williamkamkwamba.com/how-much-wind-turbine-costs/).
    
- **Additional Costs**: Site preparation ($200,000–$400,000), grid connection ($150,000–$500,000), logistics ($60,000–$120,000), installation and commissioning ($300,000–$500,000), and other expenses like permitting and insurance[5](https://williamkamkwamba.com/how-much-wind-turbine-costs/).
- 
#### Solar PV Systems

- **Utility-Scale Systems**: The capital cost for large-scale solar PV systems is approximately $51/MWh, while smaller systems cost around $149/MWh[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10201302/).
    
- **Cost Breakdown**: Includes modules, inverters, energy storage systems (if applicable), structural and electrical balance of system components, fieldwork, office work, and other costs[8](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks).
	
## **Operational Costs**

#### Wind Energy

- Annual operational costs range from $42,000 to $48,000 per turbine or about 1-2 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) produced. Offshore wind farms typically incur higher maintenance costs due to accessibility challenges[1](https://weatherguardwind.com/how-much-does-wind-turbine-cost-worth-it/)[6](https://weatherguardwind.com/wind-turbine-cost-and-roi-considerations-in-2023/)[9](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1544993).
    

#### Solar PV Systems

- Operational costs are relatively lower than wind energy. Maintenance strategies include inverter replacements and cleaning panels periodically. Variability costs for solar PV are estimated at $8–11/MWh due to fluctuations in solar radiation[10](https://www.cmu.edu/ceic/assets/docs/publications/working-papers/ceic-11-04.pdf).


## **Cost Functions**

#### Wind Energy

The cost function for wind turbines is influenced by:  
Total Cost=CapEx+OpExTotal Cost=CapEx+OpEx  
Where CapEx scales with turbine capacity (MWMW) and location-specific factors like infrastructure needs. OpEx decreases with technological improvements and learning curves (9% reduction per capacity doubling)[9](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1544993).

#### Solar PV Systems

The cost function depends on:  
LCOE=Capital Cost+Operating CostEnergy OutputLCOE=Energy OutputCapital Cost+Operating Cost  
Variables include system size (small-scale vs large-scale), solar resource availability, and financial assumptions like discount rates[8](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks).

## **Market Price of Power**

#### Wind Energy

The market value of wind power varies between 50% and 80% of the average power price depending on penetration rates. High penetration reduces prices due to oversupply during windy periods[3](https://d-nb.info/1166861082/34)[7](https://neon.energy/Hirth-2013-Market-Value-Renewables-Solar-Wind-Power-Variability-Price.pdf).

#### Solar PV Systems

Solar PV electricity costs range from $51/MWh for large-scale systems to $149/MWh for smaller installations. Prices are location-dependent due to solar irradiance variability[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10201302/)[10](https://www.cmu.edu/ceic/assets/docs/publications/working-papers/ceic-11-04.pdf).

## **Variability Across Locations**

Both wind and solar energy exhibit significant variability:

- **Wind Energy**: Prices fluctuate based on wind speeds; higher variability leads to lower market prices during peak production periods[3](https://d-nb.info/1166861082/34)[7](https://neon.energy/Hirth-2013-Market-Value-Renewables-Solar-Wind-Power-Variability-Price.pdf).
    
- **Solar PV**: Solar radiation variability impacts generation costs more in regions with less consistent sunlight. Variability adds approximately $8–11/MWh to solar PV costs[10](https://www.cmu.edu/ceic/assets/docs/publications/working-papers/ceic-11-04.pdf).


## Cost-Capacity Relationships for PV Systems: Key Equations & Models

Several studies and models quantify the relationship between PV system costs and capacity. Here are the most widely used equations and their sources:

## **1. Power Law Scaling (Economies of Scale)**

**Equation**:  
$CapEx_{PV}=a⋅C^{b}$  

- **CapEx**: Capital cost ($)
    
- C: System capacity (kW or MW)
    
- a: Baseline cost coefficient ($/kW or $/MW)
    
- b: Scaling exponent (typically b<1, reflecting economies of scale)
    

**Example**:  
For utility-scale PV (C>1 MWC>1MW):  
$CapEx=800⋅C^{0.92}$  $/kW[NREL, 2023] 
This implies a 8% cost reduction for every doubling of capacity.

## **2. Learning Curve Model (Cost vs. Cumulative Capacity)**

**Equation**:  
CapEx(t)=CapEx_{0}⋅(Q(t)Q0)−bCapEx(t)=CapEx0⋅(Q0Q(t))−b

- CapEx(t)CapEx(t): Cost at time tt
    
- Q(t)Q(t): Cumulative installed capacity at time tt
    
- CapEx0,Q0CapEx0,Q0: Initial cost and capacity
    
- bb: Learning rate (historically ~20% for PV)
    

**Source**: Wright's Law, applied in studies like _Barbose et al. (2021)_ and _IRENA (2024)_.

## **3. Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)**

**Equation**:  
$$LCOE=\frac{CapEx⋅CRF+OpEx}{Annual Generation}$$


- **CRF**: Capital recovery factor (r(1+r)n(1+r)n−1(1+r)n−1r(1+r)n, where r = discount rate, n = system lifetime)
    
- **Annual Generation**: C⋅CF⋅8760C⋅CF⋅8760 (CF = capacity factor)
    

**Source**: Standardized in _NREL's Annual Technology Baseline_ reports.

## **Key Variables in Cost-Capacity Models**

1. **System Size**: Larger systems reduce $/W costs (economies of scale in hardware, labor, and land).
    
2. **Technology Type**:
    
    - Monocrystalline Si: Higher efficiency but costlier.
        
    - Thin-film: Lower efficiency but cheaper at scale.
        
3. **Location**: Solar irradiance, labor costs, and permitting fees vary regionally.
    
4. **Balance of System (BoS)**: Inverters, wiring, and mounting structures scale non-linearly with size.

This report aims to provide a detailed economic analysis of these two pivotal renewable energy sources. By examining their capital and operational costs, exploring the relationship between system size and cost, investigating the market prices of the generated electricity, and analyzing the geographic variations in these economic parameters, this report seeks to offer valuable insights for business investors and energy analysts. A thorough understanding of the economic factors influencing wind and solar energy is essential for making informed decisions regarding investment, policy development, and strategic planning in the rapidly evolving energy sector.

3. Cost Analysis of Wind Energy Systems

3.1. Capital Costs of Wind Energy

3.1.1. Small-Scale Wind Systems (Residential and Small Commercial)

The initial investment in small-scale wind energy systems encompasses a range of expenses, including the purchase of the turbine itself, site preparation, grid connection, shipping, installation, permitting, insurance, and engineering design 3. These costs can vary considerably depending on the turbine's capacity, the specific location, and the requirements of the installation site, such as accessibility and infrastructure needs 3. For instance, a medium-scale turbine with a capacity of around 2 MW, common for both commercial and larger private applications, could have a turbine purchase cost ranging from $1.3 million to $2.2 million. Additional costs include site preparation and construction ($200,000 - $400,000), grid connection ($150,000 - $500,000), shipping and logistics ($60,000 - $120,000), installation and commissioning ($300,000 - $500,000), permitting and legal fees ($50,000 - $100,000), insurance ($20,000 - $40,000), and engineering and design ($100,000 - $250,000) 3. Cumulatively, a 2 MW turbine installation could range from approximately $2.18 million to $4.13 million 3.

The cost per kilowatt of generating capacity for small wind turbines can range from $3,000 to over $30,000, depending on factors like wind resources, local restrictions, utility rates, and electricity usage 4. For a low-cost 1.5 kW turbine, the initial investment might be between $3,000 and $5,000 4. A slightly larger 10 kW turbine could approach $40,000 in cost 4. Some installers, however, report significantly higher all-in costs for small wind turbines, ranging from $100,000 to $175,000 for systems with capacities between 5 and 15 kilowatts. These higher figures include expenses beyond just the turbine, such as permitting, tower construction, grid connection, and potentially batteries 5. In 2022, the average installed cost for small wind turbines with a capacity of less than 100 kW was $7,850 per kilowatt 1. This higher cost per kilowatt compared to larger systems suggests that small-scale wind energy may not benefit from the same economies of scale and could face higher relative soft costs like permitting and interconnection.

3.1.2. Commercial and Utility-Scale Wind Farms (Onshore and Offshore)

For commercial wind turbines, the initial investment typically amounts to millions of dollars per turbine, with a typical cost of around $1.3 million per megawatt (MW) of electricity-producing capacity 6. Most commercial wind turbines have capacities ranging from 2 to 3 MW, resulting in an initial cost of approximately $2.6 to $4 million per turbine 6. Offshore wind turbines can be significantly larger, with capacities reaching 16-18 MW, and their costs increase accordingly 6. Projections for offshore turbines indicate a cost of about $1.5 million per MW of power produced, meaning a 10 MW offshore turbine could cost around $15 million 6.

The average construction cost for onshore wind turbines in the U.S. saw a slight increase of 1.6% in 2022, reaching $1,451 per kilowatt 7. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for larger wind farms with capacities greater than 100 MW. Specifically, the cost for wind farms between 100 MW and 200 MW increased by 10% to $1,614/kW, while the cost for the largest wind farms (over 200 MW) also increased to an average of $1,402/kW, up by 1.4% 7. In contrast, construction costs for smaller wind farms (1 MW to 100 MW) continued to decrease, averaging $1,806/kW in 2022, a 7.3% reduction 7.

Data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides further detail on capital expenditures for different wind turbine ratings in 2022. For utility-scale projects, a 3.3 MW land-based turbine had a capital expenditure of $1,750 per kilowatt. Offshore wind projects showed significantly higher capital costs, with a 12 MW fixed-bottom turbine costing $4,640/kW and a 12 MW floating offshore turbine costing $6,169/kW 8. These figures were updated in the 2023 NREL review, indicating capital expenditures of $1,968/kW for a 3.3 MW land-based turbine, $5,411/kW for a 12 MW fixed-bottom offshore turbine, and $7,349/kW for a 12 MW floating offshore turbine 9. The substantial difference in capital costs between onshore and offshore wind energy is primarily attributed to the increased complexity of offshore construction, including the need for specialized foundations in deeper waters and the greater distance from shore, which impacts grid connection and logistical expenses 1.

3.1.3. Detailed Breakdown of Capital Expenditure Components

The capital expenditure for a wind energy project can be broken down into several key components. The turbine purchase, encompassing the nacelle, rotor, and blades, is a major cost element 3. Site preparation and construction, including land clearing, access roads, and the turbine foundation, also represent a significant portion of the initial investment 3. Grid connection costs are highly variable, depending on the distance to the existing power grid and the complexity of the required infrastructure 3. Shipping and logistics are influenced by the distance to the site and the need for specialized transportation, particularly for large turbine components 3. Installation and commissioning involve labor, the use of cranes, and the integration of the turbine with the grid 3. Other crucial capital costs include permitting and legal fees, insurance coverage during the installation phase, and engineering and design services 3. In 2010, wind turbines accounted for 64% to 84% of the total installed costs for onshore wind farms, while for offshore wind farms, this figure was between 44% and 50%, highlighting the greater contribution of other costs like grid connection and foundations in offshore projects 10.

3.2. Operational and Maintenance Costs of Wind Energy

3.2.1. Key Components of O&M Expenses

Operational and maintenance (O&M) costs are essential for understanding the long-term economic footprint of wind energy projects. These costs are typically categorized as annual expenses necessary for the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the turbines over their lifespan 3. Key components of O&M expenses include the costs associated with maintaining an inventory of essential spare parts and the logistics of transporting these parts to the turbine site, especially in remote locations 3. Labor costs for skilled technicians required to maintain and operate the turbines, including training and salaries, also form a significant part of O&M expenses 3. Other recurring costs include insurance, land costs, rent and taxes, service and repair, administrative tasks, and the power consumed by the turbine itself 6. As wind turbines age, their operation and maintenance costs tend to increase due to wear and tear and the harsh environments in which they often operate 6. Studies have shown that O&M costs can average 1-2 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) produced, or approximately $42,000 to $48,000 per year for a commercial wind turbine 6. For onshore wind projects, O&M costs can range from USD 0.01/kWh to USD 0.025/kWh, accounting for 11% to 30% of the project's levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Offshore wind farms typically face higher O&M costs, ranging from USD 0.027 to USD 0.048/kWh, due to the complexities of the offshore environment 11. A typical estimate suggests that running and maintaining a wind turbine costs around $40/kW per year 13.

**3.2.2. Factors Influencing O&M Costs**

Several factors can influence the operational and maintenance costs of wind energy systems. These include the project's size, location, age, and the quality of wind resources at the site 14. The specific turbine model, site conditions, the project's geographic location, and the chosen maintenance strategy also play crucial roles in determining O&M expenses 15. Turbine technology and size can also have an impact; while larger turbines may have higher initial costs, they can potentially reduce O&M costs per megawatt by spreading relatively fixed expenses across a greater energy output 13. The offshore environment presents unique challenges that lead to higher O&M costs compared to onshore wind farms, primarily due to the difficulties in accessing and servicing turbines located offshore 11.

**3.3. Cost Functions and Scaling in Wind Energy**

**3.3.1. Relationship between System Size and Capital Costs**

A key aspect of wind energy economics is the relationship between the size of the system and its capital costs. Generally, capital expenditures per kilowatt ($/kW) tend to decrease as the project size increases, indicating significant economies of scale in wind energy development 10. Deploying larger turbines can also lead to a reduction in the complexity and overall construction costs of a wind farm site 6. Research has shown that balance of system (BOS) costs, which include expenses for site preparation, foundations, and grid connections, can be substantially reduced by increasing the size of a wind power plant. For example, increasing the plant size from 150 MW to 400 MW has been estimated to potentially reduce BOS costs by as much as 21% 17. While earlier data suggested an inverse relationship between wind turbine size and specific costs (costs per kW actually increasing with capacity) 18, more recent trends indicate that larger turbines, although having higher overall purchase prices, often result in lower /kWcostsduetotheirgreaterenergycaptureandtheefficienciesgainedinlarger−scalemanufacturingandinstallation.∗∗3.3.2.ImpactofOtherVariablesonWindEnergyCosts∗∗Beyondsystemsize,severalothervariablessignificantlyinfluencethecostsassociatedwithwindenergy.Theratingofthewindturbineinmegawatts(MW)directlyaffectsitsenergyproductioncapacityandcost.Thefixedchargerate(FCR),whichrepresentstheannualcostoffinancingthecapitalinvestment,isanothercriticalfactor.Operationalexpenditures(OpEx)perkilowattperyear(/kW/yr) contribute to the ongoing costs of the project. The net annual energy production (AEPnet) in megawatt-hours per megawatt per year (MWh/MW/yr), which is heavily dependent on the wind resource at the site, determines the amount of electricity generated 8. Additionally, land costs, the expenses related to grid connection, and the overall financing costs of the project play important roles in the economic viability of wind energy 10. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is a comprehensive metric that integrates these various factors, providing a measure of the average cost to produce one megawatt-hour of electricity over the lifetime of the wind energy project 8. The formula for LCOE typically includes capital expenditures, the fixed charge rate, operational expenditures, and the net average annual energy production, offering a holistic view of the cost of electricity from wind energy 8.

3.4. Market Price of Electricity from Wind Energy

3.4.1. Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for Wind Power

The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is a widely used metric to assess the economic competitiveness of different electricity generation technologies. For wind power, the LCOE varies depending on the scale and type of the system. In 2022, the LCOE for land-based wind installations was estimated at $39 per megawatt-hour (MWh), with a range of $30 to $57/MWh 8. This increased slightly in 2023 to $42/MWh, with a range of $30 to $61/MWh 9. Offshore wind energy has a higher LCOE, with fixed-bottom projects estimated at $95/MWh in 2022 (range $52-$184/MWh) and $117/MWh in 2023 (range $76-$234/MWh) 8. Floating offshore wind has the highest LCOE among these categories, estimated at $145/MWh in 2022 (range $52-$184/MWh) and $181/MWh in 2023 (range $76-$234/MWh) 8. For distributed wind projects, the LCOE in 2022 was estimated at $235/MWh for residential systems, $163/MWh for commercial systems, and $78/MWh for large systems 8. These figures slightly increased in 2023 to $240/MWh for residential, $174/MWh for commercial, and $80/MWh for large distributed wind 9. Over the past decade, the average LCOE for land-based wind has seen a significant decline, reaching $32/MWh in 2022, a 60% decrease since 2012 1. This indicates that utility-scale land-based wind is currently the most cost-competitive among wind energy technologies.

3.4.2. Wind Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) Prices

Wind power purchase agreements (PPAs) represent the contracted price at which electricity generated from wind projects is sold to utilities or other offtakers. In the U.S., wind PPA prices averaged 2.4¢/kWh (or $24/MWh) in 2021-2022 but experienced a surge to 6¢/kWh (or $60/MWh) in North America in 2023 1. More recent data indicates a range of PPA prices from below $20/MWh to more than $40/MWh, depending on the region and specific project details 19. According to LevelTen Energy, the average wind PPA price in North America rose to $65.63/MWh in the third quarter of 2024 20. In the first quarter of 2023, LevelTen Energy reported a wind PPA index price of $51.12/MWh 21. Notably, PPA prices in the interior "wind belt" region of the country have been reported to be around $20/MWh 22. These prices, often supported by federal tax incentives, are comparable to recent solar sales prices and the projected future fuel costs of gas-fired generation 19. The recent upward trend in PPA prices can be attributed to factors such as supply chain pressures and project development timelines.

3.4.3. Average Selling Price in Wholesale Markets

The average selling price of wind turbines has seen fluctuations in recent years. In mid-2023, Nordex, a German-based manufacturer, recorded an average selling price of €890,000/MW, which translates to approximately $965,000/MW USD 6. Notably, during 2022 and early 2023, several major manufacturers increased their prices: Vestas rose to €1.2 million/MW, Siemens Gamesa to €0.8 million/MW, and Nordex/Acciona to €0.9 million/MW 23. These price escalations were driven by various factors, including the rising costs of raw materials like steel and critical minerals, disruptions in the supply chain, and quality issues affecting certain manufacturers 23. Despite the increasing trend in wind turbine prices, the average capital expenditure (CAPEX) for total wind projects has shown a continuous decline for both onshore and offshore developments 23. In 2022, the average CAPEX for onshore wind stood at $1420/kW, while offshore was at $3609/kW. Projections suggest this declining trend will continue, albeit at a slower rate, until 2050 23.

3.5. Geographic Variability in Wind Energy Costs and Prices

3.5.1. Influence of Wind Resource Availability

The availability and quality of wind resources are critical determinants of the economic viability of wind energy projects, and these resources vary significantly across different geographic locations. Capacity factors, which represent the actual energy output of a wind plant compared to its maximum potential, show substantial variability. For small wind turbines, capacity factors can range from as low as 2% to as high as 36% 5. For larger, utility-scale turbines, onshore capacity factors typically fall in the range of 30-40%, while offshore wind farms can achieve higher capacity factors, sometimes reaching up to 65% or occasionally more in favorable circumstances 6. Generally, offshore winds tend to be stronger and more consistent than those on land, leading to these higher capacity factors 1. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is directly influenced by the net annual energy production, which in turn is a function of the available wind resource 8. Therefore, regions with abundant and consistent wind resources are more likely to have wind energy projects with lower LCOEs. For example, the Lower Plains region of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and New Mexico has the largest share of U.S. wind capacity due to its favorable wind resources 24.

3.5.2. Regional Cost Differences

The costs associated with wind energy projects can vary significantly across different regions. In 2010, installed costs for onshore wind farms ranged from USD 1,300 to USD 1,400/kW in China and Denmark to between USD 1,800/kW and USD 2,200/kW in most other major markets, including North America 11. More recently, the lowest wind project costs in the U.S. have been found in Texas 22. Wind power purchase agreement (PPA) prices also exhibit regional variability, with prices in the interior "wind belt" of the U.S. being around $20/MWh, while prices in the West and East tend to average above $30/MWh 22. Interestingly, in the U.S. in 2022, construction costs for wind farms with a capacity between 1 MW and 100 MW decreased, whereas costs increased for larger wind farms (over 100 MW) 7. These regional cost differences can be attributed to a variety of factors, including variations in labor rates, the cost of materials, the complexity of permitting processes, and the maturity of the wind energy market in different areas.

3.5.3. Impact of Land Costs and Grid Infrastructure

Land costs and the availability of grid infrastructure are important economic considerations for wind energy projects, particularly for onshore developments. For farmers and ranchers, leasing their land for wind turbine installations can provide a stable annual income, often around $3,000 per MW of turbine capacity 1. However, in areas with fragmented land ownership, it can be more challenging for wind developers to secure the large contiguous tracts of land necessary for commercial wind farms 25. The cost of connecting a wind farm to the existing power grid is a significant component of the overall capital expenditure and depends on factors such as the distance to the grid and the complexity of the required infrastructure 3. Substantial investment in grid upgrades is often necessary to effectively integrate large amounts of wind energy and ensure grid stability 26. The availability of existing transmission lines and favorable land lease terms can significantly improve the economic viability of wind energy projects.

4. Cost Analysis of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems

4.1. Capital Costs of Solar PV Systems

4.1.1. Residential Solar PV Systems

The capital cost of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems can vary based on system size, component quality, and location. For a typical 2,000 square foot home, a 10-kilowatt (kW) solar panel system can average between $13,549 and $25,974 after federal tax credits 29. Before incentives, the average cost per watt for a residential solar electric system is between $2.70 and $3.25, meaning a 5-kW system could cost between $13,500 and $16,250 30. In 2025, the average cost of an 11 kW solar panel installation is around $20,552 after the federal tax credit, with the cost before the credit averaging $29,360 31. There are notable variations in solar panel costs across different states, influenced by factors such as local incentives and market conditions 29. For example, in 2025, the average cost after incentives for an 11 kW system ranges from a low of $14,223 in California to a high of $31,774 in West Virginia 31.

4.1.2. Commercial Solar PV Systems

Commercial solar PV systems generally benefit from economies of scale compared to residential systems. On average, commercial solar panels cost between $2.50 and $3.50 per watt before incentives. However, with tax credits and other incentives, this cost can be reduced to around $1.20 to $1.75 per watt 33. The total initial cost for a commercial solar panel installation can range from around $100,000 for a small business to as much as $1,000,000 for large buildings 33. The average system size for commercial solar installations is around 99.36 kW, with an average gross cost of $234,512 34. Benchmarks from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in 2021 estimated national averages for commercial solar panel costs of $1.45 to $1.56 per watt 35.

4.1.3. Utility-Scale Solar PV Systems

Utility-scale solar PV systems, due to their large size, typically have the lowest capital costs per watt. The cost of building a solar power plant is generally between $0.89 and $1.01 per watt 36. This means that a 1 MW (megawatt) solar farm could cost between $890,000 and $1.01 million 36. In the first quarter of 2023, the benchmark installation cost per watt for utility-scale solar across the U.S. rose to $1.16, according to NREL 37. Data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2021 showed variations in capital costs per kilowatt for utility-scale solar PV across selected countries, with costs in Europe at $815/kW, the United States at $1,030/kW, and China at $610/kW 38.

4.1.4. Detailed Breakdown of Capital Expenditure Components

The capital expenditure for a solar PV system includes several components. The cost of solar panels (modules) is a significant part, accounting for around 12% of the total cost for an average residential installation 31. Other key components include the solar inverter(s), which convert DC electricity to AC ($2,991 on average for an 11 kW system), racking equipment ($997), electrical wiring ($2,548), and supply chain costs ($2,659) 31. Labor costs for installation, as well as expenses for permitting and regulatory compliance, also contribute to the overall capital cost 33. For ground-mounted utility-scale systems, land costs are an additional factor 33. The cost of energy storage systems (batteries) can also add significantly to the capital expenditure, with a single solar battery typically costing between $6,000 and $13,000 29.

4.2. Operational and Maintenance Costs of Solar PV Systems

4.2.1. Key Components of O&M Expenses

Operational and maintenance (O&M) costs for solar PV systems are generally lower than those for wind systems due to the lack of moving parts. Key components of O&M expenses include routine cleaning of the solar panels to maintain efficiency, annual inspections to ensure optimal system performance, and the replacement of the inverter, which typically needs to occur every 10 to 15 years for commercial systems and potentially 5 to 10 years for residential systems 33. If the system includes energy storage, the maintenance or replacement of batteries will also be an O&M cost 33. For ground-mounted systems, managing vegetation around the solar array is another potential O&M expense 41.

4.2.2. Factors Influencing O&M Costs

Several factors can influence the O&M costs of solar PV systems. These include the size and location of the system, environmental conditions such as dust, pollution, and snow, the quality of the system components, and the maintenance practices adopted 40. Areas with more dust or pollution may require more frequent cleaning to maintain optimal energy production 42. Implementing preventative measures and choosing high-quality solar panels can help minimize long-term maintenance costs 44. Routine cleaning for a residential system can cost between $150 and $330 per session, and annual inspections may range from $150 to $300 40. For a large-scale commercial project, annual O&M costs might average around $141,000, which is just under 1% of the initial investment 41.

4.3. Cost Functions and Scaling in Solar PV Systems

4.3.1. Relationship between System Size and Capital Costs

Similar to wind energy, solar PV systems exhibit economies of scale, with the cost per watt generally decreasing as the system size increases 35. Residential solar panel systems typically have a higher cost per watt compared to commercial systems, which in turn are more expensive per watt than utility-scale solar farms 46. For example, residential solar energy costs range from $0.08 to $0.10 per kWh, while commercial or utility-scale solar power costs between $0.06 and $0.08 per kWh 46. Utility-scale projects, with their large scale, achieve the lowest capital costs per watt, making them the most cost-effective option for large-scale electricity generation 36.

4.3.2. Impact of Other Variables on Solar PV Costs

Beyond system size, other variables influence the cost of solar PV systems. The efficiency and technology of the solar panels themselves play a significant role; higher efficiency panels may have a higher upfront cost but can generate more electricity, potentially leading to better long-term savings 33. The type of mounting and racking systems used, the technology of the inverter (string vs. micro-inverters), and the inclusion of additional equipment like monitoring systems and energy storage can also affect the overall cost 31. Labor and installation costs, as well as permitting and regulatory requirements, are other important factors that contribute to the total expense of a solar PV system 33.

4.4. Market Price of Electricity from Solar PV

4.4.1. Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for Solar PV

The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar PV has seen a dramatic decline, making it increasingly competitive. In 2021, the LCOE for utility-scale solar PV in some major economies reached lows of around USD 40/MWh 38. Globally, the average LCOE from utility-scale solar PV fell to USD 0.044/kWh (USD 44/MWh) in 2023 48. NREL estimates from 2024 indicate an LCOE of $94/MWh for utility-scale PV, $126/MWh for commercial PV, and $264/MWh for residential PV 39. Notably, the LCOE of solar PV is now lower than the lowest-cost fossil fuel alternatives in many parts of the world 49.

4.4.2. Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) Prices

Prices for solar power purchase agreements (PPAs) in North America have shown an upward trend recently. In the third quarter of 2024, the average solar PPA price jumped to $56.58/MWh 20. This represents a 5.4% increase during the quarter and a 10.4% year-over-year rise 20. Globally, the LCOE for fixed-axis solar systems averages US$66/MWh, with a wide range from US$28/MWh to US$117/MWh, influenced by geography, technology, and regional market conditions 51. In the first quarter of 2023, LevelTen Energy reported a solar P25 index price of $49.52 per MWh 21.

4.4.3. Average Selling Price in Wholesale Markets

In the wholesale electricity markets, solar energy traded for an average of $29.75 per MWh according to the P25 national index 36. However, in 2019, the weighted average wholesale price for solar PV-generated electricity in the U.S. was significantly higher at 83permegawatthour(MWh),morethandoublethepricepaidforelectricityfromwind,fossilfuels,ornuclear.ThishigheraveragewaspartlydrivenbytheconcentrationofsolarcapacityinCalifornia,wheretheaveragewholesaleelectricitypriceacrossalltechnologieswashigher[52].∗∗4.5.GeographicVariabilityinSolarPVCostsandPrices∗∗∗∗4.5.1.InfluenceofSolarIrradiance∗∗Theamountofsolarirradiance,whichisthepowerperunitareareceivedfromthesun,directlyaffectstheenergygenerationefficiencyofsolarPVsystems[53,54,55,56,57].Locationsclosertotheequatorgenerallyreceivemoresolarradiation,leadingtohigherenergyproduction[58].ThelevelizedcostofenergyforsolarPVisalsoinfluencedbytheamountofsunlightavailableataspecificlocation[46,58].StudieshaveshownthatsolarirradiancecausesthemostvariationinenergygenerationfromPVsystems[54].∗∗4.5.2.RegionalCostDifferences∗∗TherearesignificantregionaldifferencesinthecostsofsolarPVsystems.Asmentionedearlier,residentialsolarcostsvaryconsiderablybystate[29,31,32].ThecostcompetitivenessofsolarPValsoshowssignificantvariationacrossdifferentregionsglobally[51].Datafrom2021indicatedthatutility−scalesolarPVcapitalcostsdifferedsubstantiallybetweencountrieslikeEurope,theUnitedStates,andChina[38].Theseregionalvariationsareduetoacombinationoffactors,includinglocallaborcosts,theavailabilityofincentives,permittingandinterconnectionprocesses,andthematurityofthesolarmarketineacharea.∗∗4.5.3.ImpactofLandCostsandGovernmentIncentives∗∗Landcostsareaconsiderationforlarge,ground−mountedsolarPVsystems,butsolarpanelsarealsofrequentlyinstalledonrooftops,whichdoesnotdirectlyaffectlandcover[59,60,61].Landownerscanleasetheirlandforsolarfarmdevelopment,providingapotentialrevenuestream[36,61,62].GovernmentincentivesplayacrucialroleintheeconomicsofsolarPV.Thefederalresidentialcleanenergycreditprovidesasignificanttaxcredit(30∗∗5.ComparativeEconomicAnalysisofWindandSolarPVEnergy∗∗AcomparativeanalysisofwindandsolarPVenergysystemsrevealsdistincteconomiccharacteristics.Intermsofcapitalcosts,utility−scalesolarPVgenerallyhasthelowestcostperkW,followedbyutility−scaleonshorewind.Offshorewind,particularlyfloatingoffshore,exhibitsthehighestcapitalcosts.ResidentialandcommercialscalesystemsforbothtechnologiestendtohavehighercapitalcostsperkWcomparedtoutility−scaleprojects,withsmall−scalewindoftenbeingthemostexpensive.OperationalandmaintenancecostsforsolarPVaretypicallylowerthanthoseforwindenergysystemsduetotheabsenceofmanymovingparts.However,bothtechnologiesrequireregularmaintenancetoensureoptimalperformance.Thelevelizedcostofenergy(LCOE)providesacomprehensivecomparisonoftheoverallcostofelectricitygeneration.Forutility−scaleprojects,land−basedwindandsolarPVhavebecomehighlycompetitive,withLCOEvaluesoftenfallingwithinasimilarrange,dependingonthespecificlocationandresourceavailability.Offshorewindanddistributedgeneration(especiallyresidential)forbothtechnologiescurrentlyhavehigherLCOEs.Eachtechnologyhasitseconomicstrengthsandweaknesses.Windenergygenerallybenefitsfromhighercapacityfactors,especiallyinregionswithstrongandconsistentwindresources.SolarPV,ontheotherhand,hasseenmoredramaticcostreductionsinrecentyearsandcanbedeployedacrossawiderangeofscales,fromindividualrooftopstomassiveutility−scalefarms.Intermittencyisaneconomicchallengeforbothwindandsolar,requiringinvestmentsinenergystorageorgridmanagementsolutions.Landusecanalsobeasignificantfactor,particularlyforutility−scaleprojects,althoughbothwindandsolarprojectscanoftencoexistwithagriculturalactivities.∗∗Table1:ComparativeLCOEofWindandSolarPV(Basedon2023NRELData)∗∗∣Technology∣Scale∣LCOERange(/MWh) |

6. Conclusion and Key Economic Insights

This analysis indicates that both wind and solar energy systems have made significant strides in reducing costs and enhancing their economic competitiveness. Utility-scale land-based wind energy currently stands as one of the most cost-effective sources of new electricity generation, with a levelized cost of energy that is competitive with or even lower than traditional fossil fuel sources. Solar photovoltaic technology has also experienced remarkable cost reductions, particularly at the utility scale, making it an increasingly attractive option globally.

Key economic insights include the significant economies of scale observed in both wind and solar energy, favoring larger projects for achieving lower costs per unit of energy. Government incentives, such as tax credits and rebates, play a crucial role in improving the economic viability of renewable energy, especially for residential and commercial solar PV. Geographic variability in resource availability (wind speed and solar irradiance) and regional factors like labor costs and permitting processes significantly influence the overall costs and market prices of electricity from these renewable sources. While offshore wind and distributed generation currently face higher costs, ongoing technological advancements and increasing deployment are expected to drive further cost reductions in these sectors.

The choice between wind and solar energy from an economic standpoint is not always straightforward and depends on a multitude of factors, including the specific application, the geographic location, and the availability of natural resources. However, the overarching trend of decreasing costs for both technologies positions them as crucial components of a sustainable and economically viable energy future. For investors and energy analysts, a comprehensive understanding of these economic dynamics is essential for making informed decisions and contributing to the continued growth of the renewable energy sector.
