- **Timeframe:** Are you looking for the most recent literature (e.g., past 5 years), or should I include older foundational works?
- **Preferred Sources:** Do you have any preference for sources such as peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, reports from organizations like the IEA, or specific databases (e.g., Scopus, Web of Science)?
- **Depth of Review:** Are you looking for a high-level summary of each topic, or a more in-depth analysis with detailed methodologies and case studies?
- **Regional Focus:** Should the research cover global studies, or are you interested in specific geographic regions (e.g., EU, US, Asia)?
- **Specific Constraints:** Any specific constraints like focusing only on green hydrogen via PEM electrolysis, or should I consider other production methods as well?
