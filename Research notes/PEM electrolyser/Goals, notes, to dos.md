	- The highest #obj1 is achieved with #var1 , #var2 , #var3, allthough it affects the ..... . also the highest #obj2 is achieved with #var1 #var2 #var3 at the detriment of #obj1 


# optimization results
The goal of the optimization is to achieve maximum efficiency of the described system while minimizing the cost of design and production. The efficiency of the system here is described in terms of the #Total_overpotential generated due to the in-efficiencies of the system described.
The objective function consist of the
- Cost of design and production
- Total overpotential generated

```Thus, for each working fluid, an objective function consisting of exergy efficiency and TCR is defined, and by changingthe effectiveness coefficient of each of the two objective functions in the main objective function, the optimization problem is performed. Finally, for different values of the effectiveness coefficient, the results are presented in Fig. 9. The informationpresented in Fig. 9 is called the Pareto front. Each point of this curve is an optimal point and can be selected as the final optimal design point.

The decision variables consist of
Three different #materials are used as candidates and evaluated

First, by performing a parametric analysis, the effect of design variables performance factors, including power production, cooling capacity, exergy efficiency and TCR, is investigated. 
Then visualizing the design space
Then, using GA, multi-objective optimization is carried out and the Pareto front is drawn for the system, considering the three mentioned #materials
#metrics are calculated to compare the results generated from different models
