𝑅(𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑡 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑑𝑒𝑟) is the ratio of catalyst powder in the dispersion, 𝑚𝑓 is the mass at the end of the coating of the piece of aluminum foil and 𝑚𝑖 is the mass of the pristine piece of aluminum foil.

where 𝑅(𝑃𝑡 𝑤𝑡) is the ratio of Pt in the catalyst powder. For instance, it is 0.4 for Pt at 40 wt %.

where 𝑆𝐴 is the active surface area (7.22 cm2 in our work). Of course, the estimation of 𝐿𝑃𝑡 is only valid if we assume that the ink dispersion is homogeneous during the spray-coating steps.


Coating program and its modeling
To model the coating configuration and pathway,

: a determines the width of the bell-shaped curve, b is a positive integer, c defines the center of the curve [47], and A1L is the amplitude of a spray layer, that is the total thickness divided by 4



the ECSA was calculated by

where, 210 μC.cm-2Pt is the value of the platinum charge density when monolayer adsorption of hydrogen on the surface of platinum crystallites is assumed.
