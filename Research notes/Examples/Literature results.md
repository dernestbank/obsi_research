4.1. Temporal complementarity between PV and wind power It is stated in Ref. [64] that the diurnal complementarity of wind power with solar PV can be assessed with hourly interval data. For example, a sizing optimization of wind, solar PV, and energy storage capacity has been simulated in Ref. [65] to minimize Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) based on the natural complementarity between wind and solar PV generation. Ref. [66] has also conducted a temporal complementarity assessment and indicated hourly complementary between PV and wind power in the United States.
