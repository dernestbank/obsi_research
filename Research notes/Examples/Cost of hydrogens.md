## Key Notes and References

- **Brown Hydrogen**: Produced from coal, typically the cheapest but with the highest emissions. Price depends on coal cost and region[1](https://jpt.spe.org/twa/the-color-palette-of-the-colorless-hydrogen)[2](https://www.energy-transition-institute.com/factbooks/hydrogen).
    
- **Grey Hydrogen**: Produced from natural gas via steam methane reforming (SMR) without carbon capture. Prices are lowest in the US and higher in Europe/Asia due to natural gas prices[3](https://hydrogen-central.com/green-hydrogen-costs-set-to-stay-too-high-for-too-long/)[1](https://jpt.spe.org/twa/the-color-palette-of-the-colorless-hydrogen)[2](https://www.energy-transition-institute.com/factbooks/hydrogen).
    
- **Blue Hydrogen**: Similar to grey, but with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Costs vary widely depending on technology, natural gas price, and CCS costs. Lower end possible with subsidies or byproduct sales, but often higher than grey[4](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/blue-hydrogen-1kg-2031-with-caveats-doe-report/701964/)[5](https://www.sgh2energy.com/economics)[6](https://www.fuelcellchina.com/Industry_information_details/4236.html).
    
- **Turquoise Hydrogen**: Produced by methane pyrolysis, yielding solid carbon instead of CO₂. Still emerging, but recent studies show competitive costs with blue hydrogen[7](https://www.kallanish.com/en/news/power-materials/market-reports/article-details/turquoise-h2-stands-as-europes-cheapest-clean-h2-pathway-study-0724/)[6](https://www.fuelcellchina.com/Industry_information_details/4236.html).
    
- **Green Hydrogen**: Made via electrolysis using renewable electricity. Costs are highly variable, depending on electricity price, electrolyzer technology, and plant scale. Subsidies can lower costs, but unsubsidized prices remain higher than fossil-based hydrogen in most regions[8](https://www.engineering.com/green-hydrogen-can-be-cheap-enough-to-compete-with-fossil-fuels-by-2030/)[9](https://www.bayern-innovativ.de/en/emagazine/detail/en/page/cost-of-sales-down-slightly-again)[10](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/20004-cost-electrolytic-hydrogen-production.pdf?Status=Master)[11](https://univdatos.com/news/pink-hydrogen-market).
    
- **Pink Hydrogen**: Produced via electrolysis powered by nuclear energy. Costs are similar to or slightly higher than green hydrogen, depending on nuclear electricity costs and electrolyzer technology[11](https://univdatos.com/news/pink-hydrogen-market)[12](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/the-hydrogen-stream-lcoh-of-subsidized-green-hydrogen-under-2-kg/)[1](https://jpt.spe.org/twa/the-color-palette-of-the-colorless-hydrogen).

The production method and source also inform the cost of the product. **Green hydrogen** comes from water electrolysis powered by solar, wind, or hydro. It yields zero direct CO₂ emissions. Its typical price ranges from $2.50 to $11.70 per kilogram[6]  @arcosHydrogenColorSpectrum2023  @curcioTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2025 . **Grey hydrogen** is made by reforming natural gas or gasifying coal without capturing CO₂. The typical price falls between $0.9 and $2.35/kg in major markets @curcioTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2025 , @huangTechnicalEconomicAnalysis2023 , @pruvostBlueGreenTurquoise2022 . **Blue hydrogen** uses the same fossil feedstocks but adds carbon capture and storage. Its life-cycle emissions depend on capture efficiency and methane leakage. The reported cost ranges from $2.33 to $4.00/kg @curcioTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2025 . **Brown hydrogen**, produced from lignite without CCS, costs about $1.20 to $2.20/kg. Black hydrogen describes hydrogen sourced from bituminous coal. Turquoise hydrogen comes from methane pyrolysis, splitting natural gas into H₂ and solid carbon. It typically costs $2.30 to $3.21/kg @swartbooiBiogasHydrogenTechnoEconomic2022 . Pink (or purple) hydrogen is made by electrolysis powered by nuclear energy. Its cost ranges from $2.75 to $7.37/kg @venizelouComprehensiveOverviewRecent2024 . White hydrogen refers to naturally occurring geological hydrogen but is rare and has no established market price yet @aimikheRecentAdvancesWhite2023 .

@curcioTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2025
gray hydrogen ($1.50$2.50/kg) remains the most cost-effective today but is increasingly constrained by carbon pricing. 
Blue hydrogen ($2.00–$3.50/kg) offers a transitional pathway but depends on CCS costs, natural gas price volatility, and regulatory support. 
Green hydrogen ($3.50–$6.00/kg)

The cost of hydrogen production varies significantly depending on the method used. ==Gray hydrogen, produced from fossil fuels without carbon capture, is the cheapest, ranging from $0.5 to $2 per kilogram.== Blue hydrogen, which includes carbon capture, costs between $1.80 and $4.70 per kilogram. Green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis with renewable energy, is currently the most expensive, ranging from $3 to $12 per kilogram, but costs are expected to decrease.

@pruvostBlueGreenTurquoise2022
pre-combustion capture can avoid up to 80% of CO2 emissions cheaply at 35 €/ton, but the final 20% of CO 2 capture is much more expensive at a marginal CO2 avoidance cost around 150 €/ton.

@venizelouComprehensiveOverviewRecent2024
H2 production costs equal 2.72 US$/kgH2 for case 1 and 1.72 US$/kgH2 for case 2, as compared to an average value of 2.3 US$/kgH2 , which is obtained for the SMR method using natural gas as a primary source.
between 2.6 and 4.85 US\$/kgH2 based on the investigated reactor type, while the cost of H2 production for Xcel Energy’s Prairie Island NPP is estimated at 0.69 US$/kgH2

``The authors of [28] compare the sustainability of several approaches to producing H2, focusing mostly on nuclear energy methods. The authors suggest the use of the thermo-ecological cost (TEC) index instead of local energy efficiency,``

## Key Notes from Peer-Reviewed Literature

- **Brown Hydrogen**: Produced from coal gasification and generally the lowest cost, but with the highest emissions. Peer-reviewed studies consistently identify this as the cheapest production route, especially in coal-rich regions[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922007066)[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236122040510)[3](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_303541.pdf).
    
- **Grey Hydrogen**: Generated from natural gas via steam methane reforming (SMR) without carbon capture. Costs are similar to brown hydrogen, with prices depending on natural gas markets[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922007066)[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236122040510)[4](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5019835)[3](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_303541.pdf).
    
- **Blue Hydrogen**: Produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Costs are higher than grey hydrogen due to CCS technology, but still lower than green hydrogen in most regions[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922007066)[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236122040510)[4](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5019835)[3](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_303541.pdf).
    
- **Turquoise Hydrogen**: Produced via methane pyrolysis, yielding solid carbon. Still emerging, but recent peer-reviewed work places costs between blue and green hydrogen[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236122040510)[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5628/3/1/2).
    
- **Green Hydrogen**: Produced through electrolysis using renewable electricity. Costs are highly variable and generally the highest, though expected to decrease with technological advances and lower renewable electricity prices[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922007066)[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236122040510)[4](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5019835)[3](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_303541.pdf)[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5628/3/1/2).
    
- **Pink Hydrogen**: Produced via electrolysis powered by nuclear energy. Costs are similar to green hydrogen, but depend on nuclear electricity prices and plant utilization rates[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236122040510)[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10016154/)[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5628/3/1/2).
