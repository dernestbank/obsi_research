_Note: All costs are reported in 2012 dollars._​[NREL ](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/libraries/hydrogen/h2a-pem-electrolysis-case-study-documentation0f186255-54ca-48ce-8a7b-647c61a9aa64.pdf?sfvrsn=c1fd332b_1&utm_source=chatgpt.com)



The U.S. Department of Energy’s H2A framework has evolved significantly since its original PEM electrolysis case studies were published in 2013. In the **2013 H2A PEM Electrolysis Production Case Study**, uninstalled capital costs (in 2012 $/kW) for a 1,500 kg/day “Forecourt” (distributed) system and a 50,000 kg/day “Central” system were reported as follows:

- **Total System**: Current Forecourt $940 /kW; Future Forecourt $450 /kW; Current Central $900 /kW; Future Central $400 /kW [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/libraries/hydrogen/h2a-pem-electrolysis-case-study-documentation0f186255-54ca-48ce-8a7b-647c61a9aa64.pdf?sfvrsn=c1fd332b_1)
- **Stack**: Current Forecourt $385 /kW; Future Forecourt $171 /kW; Current Central $423 /kW; Future Central $148 /kW [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/libraries/hydrogen/h2a-pem-electrolysis-case-study-documentation0f186255-54ca-48ce-8a7b-647c61a9aa64.pdf?sfvrsn=c1fd332b_1)

### Installed and Uninstalled Cost for PEM Electrolyzer Systems: Current and Future

#### **Current Costs (2024)**
- **Uninstalled (Manufactured) Cost:**  
  $541–$703 per kW  
  This covers the cost to manufacture the PEM electrolyzer stack and balance of plant (BOP), but excludes installation, mark-up, and soft costs[1][2].

- **Installed Cost (Turnkey):**  
  $1,300–$1,700 per kW  
  This includes the manufactured cost plus installation, construction, and soft costs at typical current production scales[1][2][3].

#### **Future Cost Projections**
- **Uninstalled Cost (2030, high-volume production):**  
  Below $450 per kW  
  With economies of scale and technology advances, uninstalled costs are projected to fall below $450 per kW for multi-GW/year production rates[1][2][4][5].

- **Installed Cost (2030, large-scale plants):**  
  $320–$400 per kW  
  For very large plants (>100 MW), installed costs could approach $320–$400 per kW by 2030, according to recent techno-economic models and learning rate analyses[4][5].

## Key Revisions Over Time
- **2016–2020**: Earlier H2A models estimated $599–$940/kW for PEM and solid oxide electrolyzers[3](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/review21/p102_james_2021_p-pdf.pdf)[4](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1346418)
- **2024 Update**: Reflects a ~3x increase in baseline capital costs ($2,000/kW) due to real-world data from demonstrations and supply chain adjustments[1](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/24005-clean-hydrogen-production-cost-pem-electrolyzer.pdf)

The analysis differentiates between distributed (smaller-scale, 1,500 kg/day) and centralized (50,000 kg/day) systems, with cost reductions anticipated through economies of scale and technological improvements.

# Definition for green hydrogen


## Definition of Green Hydrogen


## Notes on Standardization

There is currently no universally agreed-upon emissions threshold for each hydrogen color, and definitions can vary between jurisdictions and certification schemes[1](http://gh2.org/what-green-hydrogen)[5](https://ammoniaenergy.org/articles/scrap-green-and-blue-hydrogen-use-emissions-intensity-instead-new-iea-report/)[8](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/picbe-2023-0013). The International Energy Agency and other experts are moving toward classifying hydrogen based on actual emissions intensity (kg CO₂e/kg H₂) rather than color codes, to provide greater transparency and comparability[2](https://www.iea.org/reports/towards-hydrogen-definitions-based-on-their-emissions-intensity/executive-summary)[5](https://ammoniaenergy.org/articles/scrap-green-and-blue-hydrogen-use-emissions-intensity-instead-new-iea-report/)[8](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/picbe-2023-0013).

For the most authoritative and up-to-date definitions and emission ranges, refer to the International Energy Agency's report: "Towards hydrogen definitions based on their emissions intensity"[2](https://www.iea.org/reports/towards-hydrogen-definitions-based-on-their-emissions-intensity/executive-summary).
## Hydrogen Color Codes and Associated CO₂e Emissions

Hydrogen is commonly classified by color codes, which indicate the production method and associated carbon intensity (CO₂-equivalent emissions per kilogram of hydrogen):


## Literature References

- **Green Hydrogen Organisation**: "Green hydrogen is defined as hydrogen produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity through a process called electrolysis. This results in very low or zero carbon emissions"[1](http://gh2.org/what-green-hydrogen).
    
- **International Energy Agency (IEA)**: "Hydrogen production from unabated natural gas results in an emissions intensity in the range of 10-14 kg CO₂‑eq/kg H₂... Retrofitting with capture of CO₂... can bring the emissions intensity down to 5‑8 kg CO₂‑eq/kg H₂. Higher capture rates (above 90%) can reduce emissions intensity to 0.8‑6 kg CO₂‑eq/kg H₂"[2](https://www.iea.org/reports/towards-hydrogen-definitions-based-on-their-emissions-intensity/executive-summary).
    
- **ECL White Paper**: "Grey hydrogen production results in an emission range of approximately 4 to 9.5 kg of CO₂ for every kilogram... blue Hydrogen... estimated to be between 2.75 and 3.5 kilograms... green Hydrogen... can have a Carbon Intensity (CI) score of 10.51 (California Air Resources Board)"[3](https://ecldc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hydrogen-Carbon-White-Paper-Jan-2024.pdf).
    
- **Belfer Center, Harvard**: "Blue hydrogen has a much lower carbon intensity than grey hydrogen, with estimates ranging from 1 to 4 tCO₂/tH₂... Green or renewable hydrogen... No CO₂ emissions are generated during the production process"[4](https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/colors-hydrogen).

# Tax credibility


## Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit: Emission Criteria Classification

The Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, established under the Inflation Reduction Act, provides a tiered production tax credit (PTC) for hydrogen based on the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of the production process, measured in kilograms of CO₂ equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen (kg CO₂e/kg H₂). The emissions are calculated using the DOE's 45VH2-GREET model, and only hydrogen with emissions below 4 kg CO₂e/kg H₂ qualifies for the credit[1](https://www.energy.gov/articles/clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-45v-resources)[2](https://www.cbh.com/insights/articles/section-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit-final-rules-released/)[7](https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/news-media/latest-news/us-treasury-department-releases-final-rules-for-the-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit/).

## 45V Emission Tiers and Credit Values

| Lifecycle GHG Emissions (kg CO₂e/kg H₂) | Credit Percentage | Maximum Credit (if wage/apprenticeship met) |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| < 0.45                                  | 100%              | $3.00/kg                                    |
| ≥ 0.45 and < 1.5                        | 33.4%             | $1.00/kg                                    |
| ≥ 1.5 and < 2.5                         | 25%               | $0.75/kg                                    |
| ≥ 2.5 and < 4.0                         | 20%               | $0.60/kg                                    |
| ≥ 4.0                                   | Ineligible        | $0                                          |

- **Hydrogen with lifecycle GHG emissions ≥ 4 kg CO₂e/kg H₂ does not qualify for any 45V credit**[2](https://www.cbh.com/insights/articles/section-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit-final-rules-released/)[7](https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/news-media/latest-news/us-treasury-department-releases-final-rules-for-the-45v-clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit/).
    

## Key Requirements

- **Emissions Calculation**: Must use the 45VH2-GREET model, which accounts for well-to-gate emissions (all emissions up to the point of hydrogen production)[1](https://www.energy.gov/articles/clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-45v-resources)[2](https://www.cbh.com/insights/articles/section-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit-final-rules-released/).
    
- **Verification**: Annual verification by an independent third party is required to certify production volumes and lifecycle emissions[4](https://www.ushydrogenalliance.org/news/summary-of-final-regulations-for-clean-hydrogen-production-credit-\(45v\)).
    
- **Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)**: For grid-connected electrolyzers, EACs must demonstrate incrementality, temporal matching, and deliverability to count renewable or zero-emission electricity toward the emissions calculation[2](https://www.cbh.com/insights/articles/section-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit-final-rules-released/)[4](https://www.ushydrogenalliance.org/news/summary-of-final-regulations-for-clean-hydrogen-production-credit-\(45v\)).
    
- **Prevailing Wage/Apprenticeship**: Full credit ($3.00/kg) is only available if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met[2](https://www.cbh.com/insights/articles/section-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit-final-rules-released/)[6](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/clean-hydrogen-production-credit).
