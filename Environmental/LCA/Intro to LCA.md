# LCIA- Life cycle Impact assessment
-  # common LCIA methods
	- they differ in 
	1. the impact categories they include
	2.  how the impact categories are calculated
	3. elementary flows are grouped
	- 
	- ReCiPe 2016
	- EN15804+A2 (EU construction sector)
	
- - Impact categories: 
		- specific environment issue to be addressed	
		    - global warming potential (GDP)
		    - ozone depletion potential (ODP) 
		    - marine water eutrophication
		    - fresh water eutrophication
		    - fossil fuel depletion etc.
	- Impact indicators
	     the changes that are visible ore measured during the life cycle.
	     Gross energy requirement (GER)
	     ozone depletion potential(ODP)
	     Acidification potential (AP)
	     eutrophication and human toxicity
	     
- - impact factors
		- - the factors that quantify the relative impacts of differences within the same category
		-  For example, within the "climate change" category, different greenhouse gases have varying levels of impact on global warming. Methane (CH₄), for instance, has a [global warming potential (GWP)](https://helpcenter.ecochain.com/en/articles/9588517-explained-environmental-impact-categories#:~:text=that%20prescribes%20it.-,Global%20Warming%20Potential%20(GWP),-Units) 34 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO₂). Therefore, 1 kg of methane emissions is equated to 34 kg of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂-eq) in this category.
		- **Impact scores:** By applying characterization factors, LCIA converts raw LCI data into comparable impact scores,
	- **Note -**
		- Differing characterization factors:
				Slightly different estimates of how specific molecules affect an environmental impact category (difference in actual characterization factors).
				- Different [LCIA methods](https://helpcenter.ecochain.com/en/articles/9055669-explained-lcia-methods) might use different units for the impact categories, which results in differing characterization factors


Steps for LCIA 
- selection of impact categories/indicators
- classification on
- characterization
- Normalization
- Grouping
- Weighting 
- Data quality analysis
- 

## Characterization

Global warming score 
$$GW_{s} = \sum_{s} GWP_{s} \times m_{s}$$
GW is the global warming scores 
-s are different green-house gases 
GWP is the different green house gases
$$ I_{c} = \sum_{s}CF_{c,s} \times m_{s}$$
c- impact category
CFc,s — the characterization that links substance s to c
if emission of CO2: 10kg
emission of CH: 5kg
emission of so2 :1kg
GWP of co2:1
CH4:25(Kg CO2-equivalent/Kg CH4), SO2 has no GWP.

Weighting:
$$ W = \\sum_{c}WF_{c} \times I_{c}
$$

#  LCI- Life cycle Inventory
	- the quantification of inputs and outputs of a process
	- ISO 13033
	- govern by
		- Mass balance( conservation of mass)- CPC
		- Energy balance( conservation of energy): thermodynamics- 1st law
		- rxn Stoichiometery
		- Entropy: thermodynamics 2ndd law
		System flow chart
		process balancing:( input, output)
