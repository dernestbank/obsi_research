This approach would have a double benefit when using the green hydrogen generated from the electrolysis of water with renewable electricity (solar and wind energy). Strategies for the chemical storage of green hydrogen involve the reduction of carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methane, syngas, methanol, and their derivatives. The reduction of CO2 at ambient pressure to methane or carbon monoxide are rather facile processes that can be easily used to store renewable energy or generate an important starting material for chemical industry. While the methanation pathway can benefit from existing infrastructure of natural gas grids, the production of syngas could be also very essential to produce liquid fuels and olefins, which will also be in great demand in the future. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 at ambient pressure to basically methane and syngas on the surface of supported metal nanoparticles, single-atom catalyst (SACs), and supported bimetallic alloys. Basically, we will concentrate on activity, selectivity, stability during reaction, support effects, metal-support interactions (MSIs), and on some recent approaches to control and switch the CO2 reduction selectivity between methane and syngas. Finally, we will discuss challenges and requirements for the successful introduction of these processes in the cycle of renewable energies. All these aspects are discussed in the frame of sustainable use of renewable energies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdel-Mageed","given":"Ali M."},{"family":"Wohlrab","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"abdel-mageedReviewCO2Reduction2022","container-title":"Catalysts","DOI":"10.3390/catal12010016","ISSN":"2073-4344","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"16","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Review of CO2 Reduction on Supported Metals (Alloys) and Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) for the Use of Green Hydrogen in Power-to-Gas Concepts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4344/12/1/16","volume":"12"},{"id":"abdinModellingSimulationProton2015","abstract":"An enhanced model of a PEM electrolyser cell is presented, based on linked modular mathematical models of the anode, cathode, membrane and cell voltage.

However, the high manufacturing cost of the fuel cell system components remains the main barrier to their general acceptance and commercialization. The main strategy for lowering the cost of fuel cells which is critical for their general acceptance as alternative energy sources in a variety of applications is to lower the cost of the electrolyte and catalyst. An electrolyte is one of the most important components in the fuel cell and a major contributor to the cost (>$500/m2 for commercial Nafion® series). Nafion is widely used as an electrolyte in PEMs, but it has some limitations in addition to high costs such as low proton conductivity, high-temperature performance degradation, and high fuel crossover. Therefore, the development and manufacturing of low-cost and high-performance electrolyte membranes with higher conductivity (∼0.1 S·cm −1) at a wider temperature range is a top priority in the scientific community. Recent years have seen extensive research on the preparation, modification, and properties of PEMs such as non-Nafion membranes (SPI, PBI, polystyrene, polyphosphazene, SPAEK, SPEEK, SPAS, SPEN), and their composites by incorporating functionalized CNTs, GO as fillers to overcome their drawbacks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of membrane materials and manufacturing with a focus on PEMs. In particular, the review brings out the basic mechanism involved in proton conduction, important requirements, historical background, contending technologies, types, advantages and disadvantages, current developments, future goals, and directions design aspects related to thermodynamic and electrochemical principles, system assessment parameters, and the prospects and outlook.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Shahbaz"},{"family":"Nawaz","given":"Tahir"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Asghar"},{"family":"Orhan","given":"Mehmet Fatih"},{"family":"Samreen","given":"Ayesha"},{"family":"Kannan","given":"Arunachala M."}],"citation-key":"ahmadOverviewProtonExchange2022","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.099","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"44","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,22]]},"note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-27T01:28:44.837Z","page":"19086-19131","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An overview of proton exchange membranes for fuel cells: Materials and manufacturing","title-short":"An overview of proton exchange membranes for fuel cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922016123","volume":"47"},{"id":"ahmedEffectComponentsOperating2022","abstract":"Hydrogen is considered to be the fuel of the future and with the advancement of fuel cell technology, there is a renewed interest in hydrogen production by the electrolysis of water.

In addition, it is possible to generate compressed hydrogen directly in the PEM electrolyzer, thereby reducing the additional pressurization cost for hydrogen storage. The development of electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a major focus of electrolysis research. Other components, such as PEMs, gas diffusion layers (GDL), and bipolar plates (BPs) have also received significant attention to enhance the overall efficiency of PEM electrolyzers. Improvements in each component or process of the PEM electrolyzer have a significant impact on increasing the energy efficiency of the electrolyzer. This work discusses various synthesis techniques to improve the dispersion of OER electrocatalyst and reducing catalyst loading for the PEM electrolyzer. Various techniques are discussed for the development of electrocatalysts, including nanostructured, core shell, and electrodeposition to deposit catalysts on GDL. The design and methodology of new and improved GDL are discussed along with the fabrication of gas diffusion electrodes and passivation techniques to reduce the oxidation of GDL.

Accurate solar energy generation forecasts are necessary for system operation and planning. Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used in this paper to ensemble forecast solar hydrogen generation. The suggested method optimizes the dynamic hyperparameters of the deep learning model of recurrent neural network (RNN) using the BER metaheuristic search optimization algorithm and PSO algorithm. We used data from the HI-SEAS weather station in Hawaii for 4 months (September through December 2016). We will forecast the level of solar energy production next season in our simulations and compare our results to those of other forecasting approaches. Regarding accuracy, resilience, and computational economy, the results show that the BER-PSO-RNN algorithm has great potential as a useful tool for ensemble forecasting of solar hydrogen generation, which has important ramifications for the planning and execution of such systems. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is confirmed by two statistical analysis tests, such as Wilcoxon’s rank-sum and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). With the use of the proposed BER-PSO-RNN algorithm that excels in processing and forecasting time-series data, we discovered that with the proposed algorithm, the Solar System could produce, on average, 0.622 kg/day of hydrogen during the season in comparison with other algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Alhussan","given":"Amel Ali"},{"family":"El-Kenawy","given":"El-Sayed M."},{"family":"Saeed","given":"Mohammed A."},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Abdelhameed"},{"family":"Abdelhamid","given":"Abdelaziz A."},{"family":"Eid","given":"Marwa M."},{"family":"El-Said","given":"M."},{"family":"Khafaga","given":"Doaa Sami"},{"family":"Abualigah","given":"Laith"},{"family":"Elbaksawi","given":"Osama"}],"citation-key":"alhussanGreenHydrogenProduction2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Energy Research","ISSN":"2296-598X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Green hydrogen production ensemble forecasting based on hybrid dynamic optimization algorithm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1221006","volume":"11"},{"id":"amoresDevelopmentOperationStrategy2017","abstract":"Alkaline water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources is one of the most promising strategies for environmentally friendly hydrogen production.

Hydrogen has emerged as a significant potential energy carrier and a viable future replacement fuel for fossil fuels due to its renewable and pollution-free properties. Previous review papers have significantly contributed to the body of literature on the various technologies for producing hydrogen by revealing key insights into their working principles and conditions, as well as the economic and environmental aspects. In addition, they also highlighted the potential pathways to enable the application of these technologies in the context of carbon neutrality. However, these studies have not broken down the evolutionary patterns and developmental progress of either fossil fuel-based or renewable energy-based technologies used to produce hydrogen. In addition, the currently available literature does not contain the most recent research that focuses on the evolution and life cycle of each technology category from a chronological point of view. The key drivers, countries/regions, and their contributions to the field's development have received little attention. As a result, it is critical to monitor technological advances in hydrogen energy production and investigate the key enablers of these advancements. Against this backdrop, the current study employs patent analysis tools to achieve four primary goals: (1) to track the development trends in the field of hydrogen production from 2000 to 2019; (2) to identify and compare the recent development trends in the last five years according to the feedstock, i.e., fossil fuel, water, and biomass-based technologies; (3) to predict the technology life cycle of the two main groups of hydrogen production technologies (fossil and renewable); (4) to identify and compare the key drivers of hydrogen production technologies from a statistical standpoint. The findings of the study may aid in identifying technical prospects in the field of fossil and renewable-based hydrogen production, and decision-makers may use them as a reference in developing a strategic plan for future technological growth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ampah","given":"Jeffrey Dankwa"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Rizwanul Fattah","given":"Islam Md"},{"family":"Appiah-Otoo","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Afrane","given":"Sandylove"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Zhenlong"},{"family":"Yusuf","given":"Abdulfatah Abdu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Tongtong"},{"family":"Mahlia","given":"T.

Rather than focusing on the controversy surrounding the environmental friendliness of hydrogen production, the primary goal of the hydrogen economy is to introduce hydrogen as an energy carrier alongside electricity. Water electrolysis is currently gaining popularity because of the rising demand for environmentally friendly hydrogen production. Water electrolysis provides a sustainable, eco-friendly, and high-purity technique to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen and oxygen produced by water electrolysis can be used directly for fuel cells and industrial purposes. The review is urgently needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of water electrolysis technology and its modelling using renewable energy sources. While individual methods have been well documented, there has not been a thorough investigation of these technologies. With the rising demand for environmentally friendly hydrogen production, the review will provide insights into the challenges and issues with electrolysis techniques, capital cost, water consumption, rare material utilization, electrolysis efficiency, environmental impact, and storage and security implications. The objective is to identify current control methods for efficiency improvement that can reduce costs, ensure demand, increase lifetime, and improve performance in a low-carbon energy system that can contribute to the provision of power, heat, industry, transportation, and energy storage. Issues and challenges with electrolysis techniques, capital cost, water consumption, rare material utilization, electrolysis efficiency, environmental impact, and storage and security implications have been discussed and analysed. The primary objective is to explicitly outline the present state of electrolysis technology and to provide a critical analysis of the modelling research that had been published in recent literatures. The outcome that emerges is one of qualified promise: hydrogen is well-established in particular areas, such as forklifts, and broader applications are imminent. This evaluation will bring more research improvements and a road map to aid in the commercialization of the water electrolyser for hydrogen production. All the insights revealed in this study will hopefully result in enhanced efforts in the direction of the development of advanced hydrogen electrolyser technologies towards clean, sustainable, and green energy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Arsad","given":"A.

Although hydrogen seems to be beyond comparison in this regard, the need for high energy consumption for its production—mainly due to the same fossil hydrocarbons, low specific volume energy, and problems with its storage and transportation—make the production and consumption in the “hydrogen energy” chain extremely expensive, and even environmentally unattractive. Estimates show that it is significantly inferior to methane-based energy not only in terms of costs and efficiency, but also in terms of global CO2 emissions. The vast resources of natural methane, primarily gas hydrates, are able to provide humanity with energy and hydrocarbons for hundreds of years. Meanwhile, promising modern technologies for the conversion of methane into basic chemicals—including new autothermal technologies for its oxidative conversion into syngas and its direct conversion into chemicals—allow the consideration of methane not only as a fuel, but also as the basis of future organic chemistry. Methane and other hydrocarbons, synthesized using thermonuclear energy from CO2 and water—which are abundant on the Earth—can remain the most convenient mobile, easily stored and transported fuels and universal chemical raw materials, even after the inevitable transition to thermonuclear energy in the distant future. The inclusion of CO2 through the synthesis of methane into the global energy cycle will allow real global carbon neutrality to be achieved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Arutyunov","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"Savchenko","given":"Valery"},{"family":"Sedov","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Arutyunov","given":"Artem"},{"family":"Nikitin","given":"Aleksey"}],"citation-key":"arutyunovFuelOurFuture2022","container-title":"Methane","DOI":"10.3390/methane1020009","ISSN":"2674-0389","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"96-106","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Fuel of Our Future: Hydrogen or Methane?","title-short":"The Fuel of Our Future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2674-0389/1/2/9","volume":"1"},{"id":"ashokReviewRecentCatalyst2020","abstract":"This review focuses on various catalytic CO2 hydrogenation approaches for converting CO2 to fuels such as CH4.

This research focuses on optimizing RE parks for three scenarios: photovoltaic (PV)-only, wind-only, and hybrid PV-wind, with the aim of generating green hydrogen in locations with different RE potentials. To ensure rapid response to RE fluctuations, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is employed. Furthermore, this research proposes detailed models for manufacturer-provided wind power curves, electrolyzer efficiency against its operating power, and electrolyzer cost towards its capacity. Two optimization cases are conducted in MATLAB, evaluating the optimum sizes of the plants in minimizing levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) using classical discrete combinatorial method and determining the ideal PV-to-wind capacity ratio for operating PEM electrolyzer within hybrid PV-wind parks using particle swarm optimization. Numerical simulations show that wind power-based hydrogen production is more cost-effective than PV-only RE parks. The lowest LCOH, $4.26/kg H2, and the highest LCOH, $14.378/kg H2, are obtained from wind-only and PV-only configurations, respectively. Both occurred in Adum-Kirkeby, Denmark, as it has highest average wind speed and lowest irradiance level. Notably, LCOH is reduced with the hybrid PV-wind configuration. The results suggest the optimum PV-to-wind capacity ratio is 65:35 on average and indicate that LCOH is more sensitive to electrolyzer's cost than to electricity tariff variation. This study highlights two important factors, i.e., selecting the suitable location based on the available RE resources and determining the optimum size ratio between the plants within the RE park.","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.07.107","ISSN":"0360-3199","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","page":"1331-1346","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Optimal planning of renewable energy park for green hydrogen production using detailed cost and efficiency curves of PEM electrolyzer","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319924027782","volume":"79","author":[{"family":"Astriani","given":"Yuli"},{"family":"Tushar","given":"Wayes"},{"family":"Nadarajah","given":"Mithulananthan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,19]]},"citation-key":"astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024"},{"id":"audieAdvancesPredictionProtein2013","abstract":"Peptides hold great promise as novel medicinal and biologic agents, and computational methods can help unlock that promise.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is one technology that can utilize greenhouse gasses that would be otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere by producing chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide and electricity. Significant progress has been made in the experimental performance of carbon dioxide reduction systems with novel catalyst designs, new materials, and systems engineering; however, no work has linked such changes in stack design and materials to capital costs for the stack itself. Here we present an analysis that accounts for and analyzes the impacts of alternative materials and system architectures on manufactured costs of carbon dioxide reduction stacks, thus providing a framework to understand exactly how these advances impact the at-scale capital costs of these systems. Specifically, we consider the impact that the addition of a catholyte buffer layer has on an electrolyzer reducing carbon dioxide to formate, finding that the cost of manufacturing this part only increases stack costs by about $30/m2 at high manufacturing rates, while previous work finds that this part improves system performance.

To realize these opportunities, manufacturers are increasingly considering decentralized, flexible production facilities: large-scale production units are uneconomical for innovative products with a short lifespan and volatile markets. Small modular plants have low financial risks, are flexible and can respond rapidly to changes in demand. Logistics costs can be also reduced by moving production closer to customers and/or sources of raw materials. Moreover, stricter safety regulations can in many cases be more easily met using smaller distributed facilities. Modularization of chemical production can thus have potentially significant economic and safety benefits. In this article, several drivers for modular production are reviewed, and modular production architectures are evaluated based on a new metric, the value density of feedstock resources and markets for the products of a process. The links between modularization and process intensification are also discussed.

This enable faster progress towards reducing building impacts by combining established environmental impact assessment methods with artificial intelligence approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and neural networks. This article will present previous research on ML for LCA of buildings. To achieve this goal, we perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). SLR was governed by the question “What are scientific research developed for Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry in LCA and ML context?”. This SLR was performed in three databases: Scopus, Engineering Village and Web of Science, using keywords: Life Cycle Assessment, Machine Learning, Learning, Building and Neural Network. From SLR, we identified best practices, acquired and developed by other studies, clarifying how to interpret large data sets monitored through advanced analysis to improve LCA. The results showed: (i) number of articles increase in recent years; (ii) the most searched environmental indicators are energy consumption and Global Warming Potential (GWP); (iii) machine learning is mainly used for prediction impacts and; (iv) the most used ML method is Artificial Neural Networks.

However, the raw biogas contains a large share of carbon dioxide which must be removed before utilization in many applications, for example, using the gas as vehicle fuel. The process – biogas upgrading – can be performed with several technologies: water scrubbing, organic solvent scrubbing, amine scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), and gas separation membranes. This perspective presents the technologies that are used commercially for biogas upgrading today, recent developments in the field and compares the technologies with regard to aspects such as technology maturity, investment cost, energy demand and consumables. Emerging technologies for small-scale upgrading and future applications of upgraded biogas such as liquefied biogas are also discussed. It shows that the market situation has changed rapidly in recent years, from being totally dominated by pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and water scrubbing to being more balanced with new technologies (amine scrubbing) reaching significant market shares. There are significant economies of scale for all the technologies investigated, the specific investment costs are similar for plants with a throughput capacity of 1500 Nm3 raw biogas per hour or larger. Biogas production is increasing in Europe and around the globe, and so is the interest in the efficient use of upgraded biogas as vehicle fuel or in other applications. The market for biogas upgrading will most likely be characterized by harder competition with the establishment of new upgrading technologies and further optimization of the mature ones to decrease operation costs. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Fredric"},{"family":"Persson","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Hulteberg","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Tamm","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"bauerBiogasUpgradingTechnology2013","container-title":"Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining","DOI":"10.1002/bbb.1423","ISSN":"1932-1031","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","page":"499-511","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Biogas upgrading – technology overview, comparison and perspectives for the future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bbb.1423","volume":"7"},{"id":"baumannMembraneElectrodeAssemblies2016","abstract":"A hydrogen economy is one of the most promising concepts for the future energy infrastructure.

Here we show single-cell tests using commercial membranes and an in-house synthesized WO3-supported IrxRu1-xO2 anode catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized by Adam’s Fusion protocol and loaded onto the support using an annealing procedure. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared using an airbrush spraying technique. The electrolysis activity was greatly increased by adding tungsten carbide (WC) to the support, leading to a higher current density than commercial MEAs; however it also showed very fast degradation, losing most of the activity in minutes.

Hydrogen (H2) production based on solar energy is considered to be the newest solution for sustainable energy. Different technologies based on solar energy which allow hydrogen production are presented to study their benefits and inconveniences. The technology of water decomposition based on renewable energy sources, to produce hydrogen, can be achieved by different processes (photochemical systems; photocatalysis systems, photo-electrolysis systems, bio-photolysis systems, thermolysis systems, thermochemical cycles, steam electrolysis, hybrid processes, and concentrated solar energy systems). A comparison of the different methods for hydrogen production based on PV and WG systems was given in this study. A comparative study of different types of electrolyzers was also presented and discussed. Finally, an economic assessment of green hydrogen production is given. The hydrogen production cost depends on several factors, such as renewable energy sources, electrolysis type, weather conditions, installation cost, and the productivity of hydrogen per day. PV/H2 and wind/H2 systems are both suitable in remote and arid areas. Minimum maintenance is required, and a power cycle is not needed to produce electricity. The concentrated CSP/H2 system needs a power cycle. The hydrogen production cost is higher if using wind/H2 rather than PV/H2. The green energy sources are useful for multiple applications, such as hydrogen production, cooling systems, heating, and water desalination.","author":[{"family":"Benghanem","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Mellit","given":"Adel"},{"family":"Almohamadi","given":"Hamad"},{"family":"Haddad","given":"Sofiane"},{"family":"Chettibi","given":"Nedjwa"},{"family":"Alanazi","given":"Abdulaziz M"},{"family":"Dasalla","given":"Drigos"},{"family":"Alzahrani","given":"Ahmed"}],"citation-key":"benghanemHydrogenProductionMethods2023","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en16020757","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"title":"Hydrogen Production Methods Based on Solar and Wind Energy: A Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/2/757","volume":"16"},{"id":"berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In this study, on-line mass spectrometry is used to determine hydrogen permeation during proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEM-WE) operation for a wide range of current densities (0–6 A cm−2) and operating pressures (1–30 bar, differential pressure).

Major emphasis is placed on various membrane materials and their corresponding membrane performance. First, we discuss various metal membranes, including dense, alloyed, and amorphous metal membranes, which exhibit high hydrogen solubility and selectivity. Further, various inorganic membranes, such as zeolites, silica, and CMSMs, are also discussed. Major emphasis is placed on the development of polymeric materials and membranes for the selective separation of hydrogen from CH4, CO2, and N2. In addition, cutting-edge mixed-matrix membranes are also delineated, which involve the incorporation of inorganic fillers to improve performance. This review provides a comprehensive overview of advancements in gas-separation membranes and membrane materials in terms of hydrogen selectivity, permeability, and durability in practical applications. By analyzing various conventional and advanced technologies, this review provides a comprehensive material perspective on hydrogen separation membranes, thereby endorsing hydrogen energy for a sustainable future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhalani","given":"Dixit V."},{"family":"Lim","given":"Bogyu"}],"citation-key":"bhalaniHydrogenSeparationMembranes2024","container-title":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules29194676","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"19","page":"4676","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Hydrogen Separation Membranes: A Material Perspective","title-short":"Hydrogen Separation Membranes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/19/4676","volume":"29"},{"id":"bhatiaRenewableBiohydrogenProduction2021","author":[{"family":"Bhatia","given":"Shashi Kant"},{"family":"Jagtap","given":"Sujit Sadashiv"},{"family":"Bedekar","given":"Ashwini Ashok"},{"family":"Bhatia","given":"Ravi Kant"},{"family":"Rajendran","given":"Karthik"},{"family":"Pugazhendhi","given":"Arivalagan"},{"family":"Rao","given":"Christopher V"},{"family":"Atabani","given":"A E"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Gopalakrishnan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yung-Hun"}],"citation-key":"bhatiaRenewableBiohydrogenProduction2021","container-title":"Science of the Total Environment","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"144429-144429","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Renewable biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass using fermentation and integration of systems with other energy generation technologies","type":"article-journal","volume":"765"},{"id":"bhattacharyyaAssessmentWindEnergy2017","author":[{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"Rupsha"},{"family":"K.C.","given":"Sandeep"}],"citation-key":"bhattacharyyaAssessmentWindEnergy2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"title":"Assessment of a Wind Energy Conversion System for Sustainable Hydrogen Production by Alkaline Water Electrolysis in India: Effect of Geographical Location and Wind Turbine Type","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197578291"},{"id":"bigelowConformableHydrogenStorage2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Bigelow","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"bigelowConformableHydrogenStorage2018","DOI":"10.2172/1459184","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,6]]},"language":"en","number":"DOE-CTE--06967, 1459184","page":"DOE-CTE--06967, 1459184","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conformable Hydrogen Storage Pressure Vessel","type":"report","URL":"http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1459184/"},{"id":"bilgicRecentAdvancesArtificial2023","abstract":"Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been widely used by scientists in a variety of energy modes (biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, and hydroelectric).

We summarize a multi-model comparison of IRA to identify robust findings and variation in power sector investments, emissions, and costs across 11 models of the U.S. energy system and electricity sector. Our results project that IRA incentives accelerate the deployment of low-emitting capacity, increasing average annual additions by up to 3.2 times current levels through 2035. CO2 emissions reductions from electricity generation across models range from 47%–83% below 2005 in 2030 (68% average) and 66%–87% in 2035 (78% average). Our higher clean electricity deployment and lower emissions under IRA, compared with earlier U.S. modeling, change the baseline for future policymaking and analysis. IRA helps to bring projected U.S. power sector and economy-wide emissions closer to near-term climate targets; however, no models indicate that these targets will be met with IRA alone, which suggests that additional policies, incentives, and private sector actions are needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bistline","given":"John E.

Traditionally, the focus in business practice is often on the organizational controlling unit that records the corresponding costs when they occur. In those, later phases of the product lifecycle, the possibilities of exerting influence are very limited. Consequently, an accurate estimation of costs in the early design phase is an important instrument to support strategic decisions in the product engineering process. An intelligent approach based on machine learning to support cost management in the early design stage is presented. In a real-world case study using wheel cost data from a large original equipment manufacturer (OEM) we investigate the performance of a cross-validated machine learning framework using a greedy sequential forward feature selection method for dimensionality reduction, as well as grid search hyperparameter tuning in order to compare six regression algorithms. The results of the study show that it is possible to predict the costs of product components in the early design phase with an R2 of 0.960 using only seven features coming from the product design and development department. By a cluster analysis and scatter plots of prediction accuracies it is shown where the deviations in cost estimation come from.

Two categories of problems are investigated: “modification of the existing alignment” and “generation of a new alignment”. The road is modelled with fixed geometrical parameters. Several models are developed which relate the road gradients, for each constituting segment of the road, to three elements retained as influential factors in this study i.e. the earthwork cost, the energy cost and the emission cost. Two concepts are introduced to support the constructed methods: the “single level approach (SLA)” and the “multi-layered multi-level approach (MLMLA or ML2A)”. These approaches are based on the performances of test vehicles used as a proxy for characterizing the environmental profile of vertical alignments of linear infrastructures. New metrics for evaluating the performances of the vertical alignments are also introduced based on the life cycle assessment method. The final models of the vertical alignment have implemented piece-wise linearity using lower order spline polynomial techniques to decrease complexity level and maintain robustness. This enables the use of simple linear programming techniques for solving (optimizing) the developed models. The methods have been implemented in MATLAB (for the first problem type) and Python (for the second problem type) environments. Models’ performances are illustrated through simulations and application to real world cases, and validation is performed through benchmarking with results from similar studies found in the literature. Higher and lower gradient limits, powertrains and standard technologies, speed levels, load factors, and vehicle segment have all been investigated throughout this project. It is shown that the developed models can successfully be used to design vertical alignments with reduced environmental impacts, and that several other factors that influence the performance of heavy-duty vehicles on highways need to be considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Booto","given":"Gaylord Kabongo"}],"citation-key":"bootoUsingLifeCycle2021","container-title-short":"Using life cycle thinking approach to support environmental sustainability in big linear infrastructure projects: Alignment modelling, optimization and evaluation for reducing impacts to the natural environment","genre":"Doctoral thesis","ISBN":"9788247149973","ISSN":"2703-8084","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","note":"Accepted: 2021-02-08T14:34:03Z","publisher":"NTNU","source":"ntnuopen.ntnu.no","title":"Using life cycle thinking approach to support environmental sustainability in big linear infrastructure projects: Alignment modelling, optimization and evaluation for reducing impacts to the natural environment","title-short":"Using life cycle thinking approach to support environmental sustainability in big linear infrastructure projects","type":"thesis","URL":"https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2726663"},{"id":"bouzaHowEstimateCarbon2023","abstract":"Machine learning and deep learning models have become essential in the recent fast development of artificial intelligence in many sectors of the society.

These results also apply to regions outside of the U.S. with a similar climate and electric grid.

A detailed study and an optimization of the Balance of Plant (BoP) was carried out. The system was developed in laboratory by using commercial devices tailored around in house-made membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). The study regarded both the hydraulic circuit efficiency loss and its optimization by varying process parameters. Energy consumption for auxiliary devices was studied at different temperatures (40, 60 and 75 °C). Efficiency and control strategy management of the system were investigated. Despite an increase of stack performance observed at high temperature, maximum system efficiency (65% compared to HHV) was obtained at 40 °C because of moderate energy consumption by the electric heater. To evaluate the stack contribution to the overall efficiency, the present investigation was completed by a hydrodynamic study of the stack inside the system. Diffusional aspects related to the water mass distribution inside the stack were investigated through a computational fluid dynamic analysis (CFD). In particular, a 3D analysis of the whole stack composed by 120 channels and 10 cells was carried out. The model showed a quite uniform distribution of water over the individual channels and a homogeneous pressure inside the cells. Accordingly, the risk of having hot spots and gases accumulated inside the stack was minimal.","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.091","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"26","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","page":"11519-11529","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Design and testing of a compact PEM electrolyzer system","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036031991301015X","volume":"38","author":[{"family":"Briguglio","given":"N."},{"family":"Brunaccini","given":"G."},{"family":"Siracusano","given":"S."},{"family":"Randazzo","given":"N."},{"family":"Dispenza","given":"G."},{"family":"Ferraro","given":"M."},{"family":"Ornelas","given":"R."},{"family":"Aricò","given":"A.

It will enable the scale-up of renewable electricity as a primary energy source for heating, transport, and industry. However, displacing the role currently met by fossil fuels might require a price of hydrogen as low as 1 $/kg, whereas renewable hydrogen produced using electrolysis is currently 10 $/kg. This article explores how mass manufacturing of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers can reduce the capital cost and, thus, make the production of renewable power to hydrogen gas (PtG) more economically viable. A bottom up direct manufacturing model was developed to determine how economies of scale can reduce the capital cost of electrolysis. The results demonstrated that (assuming an annual production rate of 5000 units of 200 kW PEM electrolysis systems) the capital cost of a PEM electrolysis system can reduce from 1990 $/kW to 590 $/kW based on current technology and then on to 431 $/kW and 300 $/kW based on the an installed capacity scale-up of ten- and one-hundred-fold, respectively. A life-cycle costing analysis was then completed to determine the importance of the capital cost of an electrolysis system to the price of hydrogen. It was observed that, based on current technology, mass manufacturing has a large impact on the price of hydrogen, reducing it from 6.40 $/kg (at 10 units units per year) to 4.16 $/kg (at 5000 units per year). Further analysis was undertaken to determine the cost at different installed capacities and found that the cost could reduce further to 2.63 $/kg and 1.37 $/kg, based on technology scale-up by ten- and one hundred-fold, respectively. Based on the 2030 (and beyond) baseline assumptions, it is expected that hydrogen production from PEM electrolysis could be used as an industrial process feed stock, provide power and heat to buildings and as a fuel for heavy good vehicles (HGVs). In the cases of retrofitted gas networks for residential or industrial heating solutions, or for long distance transport, it represents a more economically attractive and mass-scale compatible solution when compared to electrified heating or transport solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bristowe","given":"George"},{"family":"Smallbone","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"bristoweKeyTechnoEconomicManufacturing2021","container-title":"Hydrogen","DOI":"10.3390/hydrogen2030015","ISSN":"2673-4141","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"273-300","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Key Techno-Economic and Manufacturing Drivers for Reducing the Cost of Power-to-Gas and a Hydrogen-Enabled Energy System","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4141/2/3/15","volume":"2"},{"id":"brownEstimatingRenewableEnergy2016","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Austin"},{"family":"Beiter","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Heimiller","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Carolyn"},{"family":"Denholm","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Melius","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Hettinger","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Mulcahy","given":"David"},{"family":"Porro","given":"Gian"}],"citation-key":"brownEstimatingRenewableEnergy2016","container-title":"Renewable Energy","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Estimating Renewable Energy Economic Potential in the United States: Methodology and Initial Results","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"brundtlandBrundtlandReportOur1987","author":[{"family":"Brundtland","given":"Gro Harlem"}],"citation-key":"brundtlandBrundtlandReportOur1987","container-title":"Comissão Mundial","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987"]]},"page":"17-25","title":"Brundtland report.

Hydrogen from biomass sources can significantly contribute to integrate the renewable hydrogen supply through electrolysis at large-scale production. Specifically, it can cover the non-continuous production of green hydrogen coming from solar and wind energy, to offer an alternative solution to such industrial sectors necessitating of stable supply. Biomass-derived hydrogen can be produced either from thermochemical pathways (i.e., pyrolysis, liquefaction, and gasification) or from biological routes (i.e., direct or indirect-biophotolysis, biological water–gas shift reaction, photo- and dark-fermentation). The paper reviews several production pathways to produce hydrogen from biomass or biomass-derived sources (biogas, liquid bio-intermediates, sugars) and provides an exhaustive review of the most promising technologies towards commercialisation. While some pathways are still at low technology readiness level, others such as the steam bio-methane reforming and biomass gasification are ready for an immediate market uptake. The various production pathways are evaluated in terms of energy and environmental performances, highlighting the limits and barriers of the available LCA studies. The paper shows that hydrogen production technologies from biomass appears today to be an interesting option, almost ready to constitute a complementing option to electrolysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Buffi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Prussi","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Scarlat","given":"Nicolae"}],"citation-key":"buffiEnergyEnvironmentalAssessment2022","container-title":"Biomass and Bioenergy","container-title-short":"Biomass and Bioenergy","DOI":"10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.106556","ISSN":"0961-9534","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"page":"106556","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Energy and environmental assessment of hydrogen from biomass sources: Challenges and perspectives","title-short":"Energy and environmental assessment of hydrogen from biomass sources","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953422002185","volume":"165"},{"id":"buhlerCatalystCoatedMembranes2019","abstract":"From Catalyst Coated Membranes to Porous Transport Electrode Based Configurations in PEM Water Electrolyzers, Melanie Bühler, Peter Holzapfel, David McLaughlin, Simon Thiele","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bühler","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Holzapfel","given":"Peter"},{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"David"},{"family":"Thiele","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"buhlerCatalystCoatedMembranes2019","container-title":"Journal of The Electrochemical Society","container-title-short":"J.

This is especially evident for an anode polarised to a high potential and in contact with an acidic membrane. Such a combination is detrimental to the vast majority of electron-conducting materials. Nowadays Ti (possessing a protective passive layer on its surface) is used as the construction material of an anode gas diffusion layer. Since the passivation layer itself is non-/semiconducting, an excessive degree of passivation leads to high surface contact resistance and to energy losses during PEM WE operation. This problem is usually solved by coating the Ti surface with precious metals. This leads to a further increase of the already very high cell investment costs. In this work an alternative method based on appropriate Ti etching (in acid) is presented. The (surface) composition of the samples treated was investigated using SEM, X-ray fluorescence and diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. TiHx was found in the subsurface layer. This was responsible for preventing excessive passivation of the Ti metal. The superior performance of the etched Ti gas diffusion layer (compared to non-etched) in a PEM water electrolyser was confirmed during an (> 100 h) experiment with current densities of up to 1 A cm− 2. Using the described treatment the surface contact resistance was substantially reduced and its increase during PEM WE operation was largely suppressed. As this method is very simple and cheap, it has tremendous potential for improving PEM WE process efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bystron","given":"T."},{"family":"Vesely","given":"M."},{"family":"Paidar","given":"M."},{"family":"Papakonstantinou","given":"G."},{"family":"Sundmacher","given":"K."},{"family":"Bensmann","given":"B."},{"family":"Hanke-Rauschenbach","given":"R."},{"family":"Bouzek","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"bystronEnhancingPEMWater2018","container-title":"Journal of Applied Electrochemistry","container-title-short":"J Appl Electrochem","DOI":"10.1007/s10800-018-1174-6","ISSN":"1572-8838","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"713-723","source":"Springer Link","title":"Enhancing PEM water electrolysis efficiency by reducing the extent of Ti gas diffusion layer passivation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10800-018-1174-6","volume":"48"},{"id":"cahalanAnalysisMembranesUsed2017","abstract":"This paper presents experimental water vapour transfer results and model analysis, using theory proposed within, of state of the art flat sheet membranes used in external membrane humidification of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells.

The models in this paper use a lumped parameter version of Fick's law of diffusion with an extra dimensionless function X, which relates the partial vapour pressure of the bulk flow to the partial vapour pressure at membrane surface, as well as the percentage of membrane area which is used due to the channel geometry of the membrane test module. Using this extra dimensionless function X allows a membrane specific parameter P′ to be calculated using experimental data to compare each membrane.

Research on environmentally sustainable practice within SMEs is minimal, and business leaders do not possess a clear understanding of how to link the implementation of green practice to the ultimate bottomline cost. The purpose of this study was to explore the opportunities to implement LCA into a SME. A qualitative case study, based on Epstein’s theoretical framework of corporate sustainability, was conducted within a SME. The primary research question involved identifying the steps necessary to implement sustainable practice using LCA. Data collected from a purposeful sample of 7 structured interviews, direct observations and document review was coded and analyzed. Emergent themes described in the presentation of the findings highlight the lack of incentives for employers and employees to participate in green practices, the need for education, and the opportunity for SMEs to form partnerships with general contractors in the construction industry. These themes were used to address opportunities for improving environmental management systems at the SME, and the steps necessary to implement LCA were documented. The LCA which was developed as a result of this research provides a comprehensive examination of the ecological aspects of selected processes at the case-study site. Implications for positive social change include opportunities for leaders to integrate green methods such as LCA into business operations.

However, to achieve it, it is necessary to focus efforts on improving features of hydrogen-based systems, such as efficiency, start-up time, lifespan, and operating power range, among others. A key sector in the development of hydrogen technology is its production, renewable if possible, with the objective to obtain increasingly efficient, lightweight, and durable electrolyzers. For this, scientific works are currently being produced on stacks technology improvement (mainly based on two technologies: polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and alkaline) and on the balance of plant (BoP) or the industrial plant (its size depends on the power of the electrolyzer) that runs the stack for its best performance. PEM technology offers distinct advantages, apart from the high cost of its components, its durability that is not yet guaranteed and the availability in the MW range. Therefore, there is an open field of research for achievements in this technology. The two elements to improve are the stacks and BoP, also bearing in mind that improving BoP will positively affect the stack operation. This paper develops the design, implementation, and practical experimentation of a BoP for a medium-size PEM electrolyzer. It is based on the realization of the optimal design of the BoP, paying special attention to the subsystems that comprise it: the power supply subsystem, water management subsystem, hydrogen production subsystem, cooling subsystem, and control subsystem. Based on this, a control logic has been developed that guarantees efficient and safe operation. Experimental results validate the designed control logic in various operating cases, including warning and failure cases. Additionally, the experimental results show the correct operation in the different states of the plant, analyzing the evolution of the hydrogen flow pressure and temperature. The capacity of the developed PEM electrolysis plant is probed regarding its production rate, wide operating power range, reduced pressurization time, and high efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Caparrós Mancera","given":"Julio José"},{"family":"Segura Manzano","given":"Francisca"},{"family":"Andújar","given":"José Manuel"},{"family":"Vivas","given":"Francisco José"},{"family":"Calderón","given":"Antonio José"}],"citation-key":"caparrosmanceraOptimizedBalancePlant2020","container-title":"Electronics","DOI":"10.3390/electronics9050871","ISSN":"2079-9292","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"5","page":"871","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"An Optimized Balance of Plant for a Medium-Size PEM Electrolyzer: Design, Control and Physical Implementation","title-short":"An Optimized Balance of Plant for a Medium-Size PEM Electrolyzer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/5/871","volume":"9"},{"id":"caputoRethinkingRoleTechnology2023","abstract":"Recognizing the interdisciplinary debate about the digital devices and infrastructure needed to support the emergence and viability of smart cities, the latter can be considered one of the most challenging topics within recent decades due to its relevant role in supporting and enhancing citizens’ participation in public management.

The transition to a net-zero energy system changes the geopolitics of energy and while alleviating some problems might cause others. In this paper we firstly map the evolution of the energy security concept and the place of hydrogen in that discussion. Although a transition to a green energy system is considered a positive development taking into consideration the climate needs, the shift itself may also bring challenges. We point out three categories of risks linked to the wider use of green hydrogen: geopolitical, market and trade challenges. Secondly, we evaluate the cost of green hydrogen and its derivatives from eight exporting countries to the port of Rotterdam and evaluate cost developments in several 2035 and 2050 scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Carlson","given":"Ewa Lazarczyk"},{"family":"Pickford","given":"Kit"},{"family":"Nyga-Łukaszewska","given":"Honorata"}],"citation-key":"carlsonGreenHydrogenEvolving2023","container-title":"Renewable Energy","container-title-short":"Renewable Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.renene.2023.119410","ISSN":"0960-1481","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"page":"119410","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Green hydrogen and an evolving concept of energy security: Challenges and comparisons","title-short":"Green hydrogen and an evolving concept of energy security","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148123013253","volume":"219"},{"id":"carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013","abstract":"Hydrogen is often considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist.

A planetary boundary, or upper tolerable limit, for P discharge to the oceans is thought to be ten times the pre-industrial rate, or more than three times the current rate. However this boundary does not take account of freshwater eutrophication. We analyzed the global P cycle to estimate planetary boundaries for freshwater eutrophication. Planetary boundaries were computed for the input of P to freshwaters, the input of P to terrestrial soil, and the mass of P in soil. Each boundary was computed for two water quality targets, 24 mg P m − 3, a typical target for lakes and reservoirs, and 160 mg m − 3, the approximate pre-industrial P concentration in the world’s rivers. Planetary boundaries were also computed using three published estimates of current P flow to the sea. Current conditions exceed all planetary boundaries for P. Substantial differences between current conditions and planetary boundaries demonstrate the contrast between large amounts of P needed for food production and the high sensitivity of freshwaters to pollution by P runoff. At the same time, some regions of the world are P-deficient, and there are some indications that a global P shortage is possible in coming decades. More efficient recycling and retention of P within agricultural ecosystems could maintain or increase food production while reducing P pollution and improving water quality. Spatial heterogeneity in the global P cycle suggests that recycling of P in regions of excess and transfer of P to regions of deficiency could mitigate eutrophication, increase agricultural yield, and delay or avoid global P shortage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Stephen R"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Elena M"}],"citation-key":"carpenterReconsiderationPlanetaryBoundary2011","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

Recently, the application of TEA has been observed to have exponential growth due to the increasing competition among businesses across various industries. Thus, this review presents a deliberate overview of TEA to inculcate the importance and relevance of TEA. To further support the aforementioned points, this review article starts with a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the applicability of TEA within the research community. Conventional TEA is widely known to be conducted via software modeling (i.e., Python, AMIS, MATLAB, Aspen HYSYS, Aspen Plus, HOMER Pro, FORTRAN, R, SysML and Microsoft Excel) without involving any correlation or optimization between the process and economic performance. Apart from that, due to the arrival of the industrial revolution (IR) 4.0, industrial processes are being revolutionized into smart industries. Thus, to retain the integrity of TEA, a similar evolution to smart industries is deemed necessary. Studies have begun to incorporate data-driven technologies (i.e., artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain) into TEA to effectively optimize both processes and economic parameters simultaneously. With this, this review explores the integration of data-driven technologies in the TEA framework. From literature reviews, it was found that genetic algorithm (GA) is the most applied data-driven technology in TEA, while the applications of blockchain, machine learning (ML), and artificial neural network (ANN) in TEA are still considerably scarce. Not to mention other advanced technologies, such as cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT, cloud computing, big data analytics, digital twin (DT), and metaverse are yet to be incorporated into the existing TEA. The inclusion of set-up costs for the aforementioned technologies is also crucial for accurate TEA representation of smart industries deployment. Overall, this review serves as a reference note for future process engineers and industry stakeholders who wish to perform relevant TEA, which is capable to cover the new state-of-art elements under the new modern era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Chai","given":"Slyvester Yew Wang"},{"family":"Phang","given":"Frederick Jit Fook"},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Lip Siang"},{"family":"Ngu","given":"Lock Hei"},{"family":"How","given":"Bing Shen"}],"citation-key":"chaiFutureEraTechnoeconomic2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Sustainability","ISSN":"2673-4524","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Future era of techno-economic analysis: Insights from review","title-short":"Future era of techno-economic analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsus.2022.924047","volume":"3"},{"id":"chammamMultiobjectiveOptimizationPerformance2023","abstract":"In this article, the optimal design of a novel multi-generation system for the production of electricity, cooling, heat and freshwater is discussed.

However, the SMR process suffers with insufficient catalytic activity, low long-term stability, and excessive energy input, mostly due to the handling of large amount of CO2 coproduced. With the demand for anticipated hydrogen production to reach 122.5 M tons in 2024, novel and upgraded catalytic processes are desired for more effective utilization of precious natural resources.

Finally, we discussed the new progresses of methane conversion: direct decomposition to hydrogen and solid carbon and selective oxidation in mild conditions to hydrogen containing liquid organics (i.e., methanol, formic acid, and acetic acid), which serve as alternative hydrogen carriers.

This requires in the first place, accelerating the introduction of green alternatives for the standing carbon-based energy technologies, and simultaneously increasing the contribution of the carbon-free renewables to our energy sector. Among a few catalytic processes, the methanation of carbon oxides is currently envisaged as a cornerstone in the renewable energy concepts. On one hand, the methanation of CO is intensively studied for ultra-purification of reforming-generated hydrogen feed gases used in the low-temperature hydrogen fuel cells and in the production of ammonia. This involves the selective methanation of CO in CO2-rich H2 fuels to lower CO concentration from about 5000 ppm down to <5 ppm. The other major application involves the solo or the total methanation of CO and CO2. This involves the conversion of syngas or the methanation of air-captured CO2 using green hydrogen produced from renewable energies (power-to-gas). These aspects revive the importance of Sabatier reactions and presents them as an essential part of the cycle of renewable-energy applications. In this review, we will focus on the recent advancements of the methanation of CO and CO2 on oxide supported Ni and Ru catalysts in the frame of their use in the abovementioned applications. After an overview of different catalytic processes related to hydrogen production, we will basically concentrate on the structure-reactivity relationships of CO and CO2 methanation in different applications, highlighting limitations and advantages of different catalytic systems. Basically, we will map out the interplay of different electronic and structural features and correlate them to the catalytic performance for CO and CO2 methanation. This includes the discussion of metal particle size effect, nature of the support, and the effect of reaction gas atmospheres. Clarifying the interplay of these parameters will help us to further understand the metal-support interaction (MSI) based on structural (SMSIs) and electronic (EMSIs) aspects which is essential for steering the catalytic performance of these catalysts for a specific reaction pathway.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Shilong"},{"family":"Abdel-Mageed","given":"Ali M."}],"citation-key":"chenMethanationReactionsChemical2023","collection-title":"Catalytic Hydrogen Purification","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.196","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"64","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"page":"24915-24935","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Methanation reactions for chemical storage and purification of hydrogen: Overview and structure-reactivity correlations in supported metals","title-short":"Methanation reactions for chemical storage and purification of hydrogen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922059122","volume":"48"},{"id":"chenMultiobjectiveOptimizationDesign2024","abstract":"Proton exchange membrane electrolytic cells (PEMECs) are considered cleaner energy-conversion devices with potential commercial applications in hydrogen production. However, the heat- and mass-transfer characteristics inside the cell remain unclear, and its performance should be optimized to achieve future commercial applications. A three-dimensional multi-physical field-coupling model is developed for the PEMEC. Subsequently, a multi-objective optimization design is used to optimize the structural and operational parameters of the cell based on a neural-network regression model. The results of the sensitivity and response-surface analyses indicate that the initial working temperature has the most significant impact on the reaction temperature, the current density is increased by up to 65.22% under the coupling effects of temperature and flow rate. The cell performance is also enhanced by the increased channel width and depth, although this is accompanied by limitations. Under the combined effects of increasing the working temperature and channel width or height, the current density can be increased by a maximum of 65.22% and 38.61%, respectively. The improvement in cell performance requires a trade-off between improved mass and heat transfer and larger pressure drop, and the optimal design achieves this trade-off. In optimal design, the current density is improved by up to 16.56%, the oxygen mass fraction of the catalytic layer is reduced by 40.90% compared with the original design, accompanied by a reasonable pressure drop and uniform temperature distribution. This study provides a novel perspective for the optimization of the PEMEC to promote its commercial application, offering a reference for further advanced optimization of cell performance and reducing trial-and-error costs.

In present work, a two-dimensional (2-D) multi-physics model is established for PEM electrolyzer to describe the two-phase flow, electron/proton transfer, mass transport, and water electrolysis kinetics with focus on the porous transport layer (PTL) and the channel-land structure. After comparing four sets of experimental data, the model is employed to investigate PTL thickness impact on liquid water saturation and local current density. It is found that the PTL under the land may have much lower liquid saturation than that under the channel due to land blockage. The PTL thickness may significantly impact liquid water access to the catalyst layer (CL) under the land. Specifically, the 100 μm thick PTL shows less than 1% liquid saturation at the CL-PTL interface under 4–5 A/cm2, leading to water starvation and electrolyzer voltage increase. As the operating current density decreases under 2–3.5 A/cm2, the liquid saturation recovers and increases to about 10–20%. In thicker PTLs, the liquid saturation is higher under the land reaching 30–40% at the CL-PTL interface under 5 A/cm2 for 200 and 500 μm thick PTLs. For the 100 μm thick PTL, the local current density drops to below 0.5 A/cm2 under the land with 5 A/cm2 average current density. For the 200 and 500 μm thick PTLs, the local current is almost uniform in the in-plane direction. The numerical model is extremely valuable to investigate PTL properties and dimensions to optimize channel-land design and configuration for high performing electrolyzers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Hui"}],"citation-key":"chenTwodimensionalMultiphysicsModeling2020","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.148","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"58","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,27]]},"page":"32984-32994","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Two-dimensional multi-physics modeling of porous transport layer in polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer for water splitting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319920335886","volume":"45"},{"id":"chenUniversalMachineLearning","abstract":"Advanced Functional Materials, part of the prestigious Advanced portfolio and a top-tier materials science journal, publishes outstanding research across the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Letian"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Sai"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhengyu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Suya"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhen"}],"citation-key":"chenUniversalMachineLearning","DOI":"10.1002/adfm.202208418","language":"en","source":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com","title":"A Universal Machine Learning Framework for Electrocatalyst Innovation: A Case Study of Discovering Alloys for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction","title-short":"A Universal Machine Learning Framework for Electrocatalyst Innovation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202208418"},{"id":"chironeCarbonCaptureUtilization2022","abstract":"The production of synthetic methane using CO2 from flue gases and green hydrogen appears to be a promising way to combine the concepts of renewable energy, chemical storage, and utilization of CO2. Recently, a new reactor configuration for catalytic methanation has been proposed, integrating sorption-enhanced methanation and chemical looping in interconnected fluidized bed systems. This configuration would ensure high methane yields while keeping good temperature control and low operating pressure. In this work, such novel system layout for the catalytic production of methane was combined with a calcium looping unit for CO2 capture from flue gases of a coal-fired power plant, and with a water electrolyzer sustained by renewable energy. The integrated layout offers a series of advantages deriving from the integration of different mass and energy flows of the different sections of the plant. The performance of this latter was assessed in terms of construction and production costs, as well as from an environmental point of view: a life cycle assessment was carried out to quantify the environmental impact of all process units. Results of the techno-economic analysis indicated that the production cost of methane is higher than that of natural gas (0.66 vs 0.17 €/Nm3), but lower than that of biomethane (1 €/Nm3). The largest impact on such costs comes from the PEM electrolyzer. The LCA analysis showed that the environmental performance is better in some categories and worse in others with respect to traditional scenarios. Again, the PEM electrolyzer appears to account for most of the environmental impacts of the process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chirone","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Paulillo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Coppola","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Scala","given":"Fabrizio"}],"citation-key":"chironeCarbonCaptureUtilization2022","container-title":"Fuel","container-title-short":"Fuel","DOI":"10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125255","ISSN":"0016-2361","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"page":"125255","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Carbon capture and utilization via calcium looping, sorption enhanced methanation and green hydrogen: A techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment study","title-short":"Carbon capture and utilization via calcium looping, sorption enhanced methanation and green hydrogen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236122020932","volume":"328"},{"id":"chisholm3DPrintedFlow2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Chisholm","given":"Greig"},{"family":"J. Kitson","given":"Philip"},{"family":"D. Kirkaldy","given":"Niall"},{"family":"G. Bloor","given":"Leanne"},{"family":"Cronin","given":"Leroy"}],"citation-key":"chisholm3DPrintedFlow2014","container-title":"Energy & Environmental Science","DOI":"10.1039/C4EE01426J","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"3026-3032","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","source":"pubs.rsc.org","title":"3D printed flow plates for the electrolysis of water: an economic and adaptable approach to device manufacture","title-short":"3D printed flow plates for the electrolysis of water","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/ee/c4ee01426j","volume":"7"},{"id":"choeComprehensiveAssessmentCO2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Choe","given":"Changgwon"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Boreum"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Ayeon"},{"family":"Cheon","given":"Seunghyun"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Hankwon"}],"citation-key":"choeComprehensiveAssessmentCO2021","container-title":"Green Chemistry","DOI":"10.1039/D1GC02755G","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"9502-9514","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","source":"pubs.rsc.org","title":"Comprehensive assessment of CO 2 methanation: which H 2 production pathway is practicable for green methane production in terms of technical, economic, and environmental aspects?","title-short":"Comprehensive assessment of CO 2 methanation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/gc/d1gc02755g","volume":"23"},{"id":"chungDesignSpacePEM2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is a promising pathway for producing low-carbon hydrogen via electrolysis coupled to variable renewable energy (VRE).

Part of this renewable energy can be supplied by the production of electricity from photovoltaic panels and windfarms. The massive use of these intermittent energies will lead to overproduction periods, and there is consequently a need to convert this surplus of electricity into a storable form of energy. Power-to-gas (PtG) technology consists in using electricity to convert water into hydrogen by electrolysis, and then to synthetize methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Techno-economic and Life Cycle Assessment of methane production via the combination of anaerobic digestion and PtG technology have been applied to sewage sludge valorization. Process studies and equipment design have been addressed considering already available technologies. Sensitivity analyses have been done on biogas upgrading technologies, electricity prices, annual operation time and composition of the electricity mix with also a comparison between PtG and direct injection. It appears that the more the electricity is expensive, the longer the operation time of the methanation process must be to be competitive with injection of methane from biogas. Reduction of electricity consumption of the electrolysis step decreases production costs. Even if the current context does not feature adapted conditions to ensure an economically viable chain, the evolution of the energetic context in the next few years as well as the expected technological improvements will contribute to overall cost reduction. From an environmental point of view, continuous PtG generates more greenhouse gases than direct injection, but intermittent operation with use of renewable electricity can significantly reduce GHG emissions. From an endpoint impacts perspective, impact from continuous PtG are higher than biogas upgrading, but much lower than fossil energy. Future development of low electricity consumption of the electrolysis process, and integration of renewable credits from CO2 valorization can increase the competitiveness of this technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Collet","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Flottes","given":"Eglantine"},{"family":"Favre","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Raynal","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Pierre","given":"Hélène"},{"family":"Capela","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Peregrina","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"colletTechnoeconomicLifeCycle2017","container-title":"Applied Energy","container-title-short":"Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.181","ISSN":"0306-2619","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,15]]},"page":"282-295","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-economic and Life Cycle Assessment of methane production via biogas upgrading and power to gas technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916312909","volume":"192"},{"id":"comsPFSAMembraneThickness2022","abstract":"PFSA Membrane Thickness Impact on Chemical Degradation Rates, Frank D.

In recent years, SOFCs have received growing attention in the scientific landscape of high efficiency energy technologies. They are fuel flexible, highly efficient, and environmentally sustainable. The high working temperature makes it possible to work in cogeneration, and drive downstream bottomed cycles such as Brayton and Hirn/Rankine ones, thus configuring the hybrid system of a SOFC/turbine with very high electric efficiency. Fuel flexibility makes SOFCs independent from pure hydrogen feeding, since hydrocarbons can be fed directly to the SOFC and then converted to a hydrogen rich stream by the internal thermochemical processes. SOFC is also able to convert carbon monoxide electrochemically, thus contributing to energy production together with hydrogen. SOFCs are much considered for being supplied with biofuels, especially biogas and syngas, so that biomass gasifiers/SOFC integrated systems contribute to the “waste to energy” chain with a significant reduction in pollution. The paper also deals with the analysis of techno-energy performance by means of ad hoc developed numerical modeling, in relation to the main operating parameters. Ample prominence is given to the aspect of fueling, emphasizing fuel processing with a deep discussion on the impurities and undesired phenomena that SOFCs suffer. Constituent materials, geometry, and design methods for the balance of plant were studied. A wide analysis was dedicated to the hybrid system of the SOFC/turbine and to the integrated system of the biomass gasifier/SOFC. Finally, an overview of SOFC system manufacturing companies on SOFC research and development worldwide and on the European roadmap was made to reflect the interest in this technology, which is an important signal of how communities are sensitive toward clean, low carbon, and efficient technologies, and therefore to provide a decisive and firm impulse to the now outlined energy transition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Corigliano","given":"Orlando"},{"family":"Pagnotta","given":"Leonardo"},{"family":"Fragiacomo","given":"Petronilla"}],"citation-key":"coriglianoTechnologySolidOxide2022","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su142215276","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"22","page":"15276","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"On the Technology of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Energy Systems for Stationary Power Generation: A Review","title-short":"On the Technology of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Energy Systems for Stationary Power Generation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/22/15276","volume":"14"},{"id":"cornagoHowCanTransformers2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cornago","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Ramakrishna","given":"Seeram"},{"family":"Low","given":"Jonathan Sze Choong"}],"citation-key":"cornagoHowCanTransformers2023","container-title":"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","container-title-short":"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","DOI":"10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107062","ISSN":"0921-3449","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"page":"107062","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"How can Transformers and large language models like ChatGPT help LCA practitioners?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344923001982","volume":"196"},{"id":"cortes-penaBioSTEAMFastFlexible2020","abstract":"BioSTEAM, the Biorefinery Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules, is an open-source steady-state process simulator in Python that enables biorefinery design, simulation, and techno-economic analysis (TEA) under uncertainty through its fast and flexible framework.

Flexible operation of the complete electrolysis unit is influenced by system design and auxiliaries: this work provides an insight on the dynamics of integrated components, aiming at the enhancement of the flexible operation of an industrial-scale PEM electrolysis system. A numerical dynamic model of a complete electrolysis unit is implemented with the software Simulink, combining customized dynamic models of the main balance of plant components. Mass and energy balances are solved during variable load operation, while PI–type and on–off controllers are included for system operation control. The electrolysis stack performance depends on semi-empirical polarization curves, reflecting voltage dependance on temperature, pressure, and current density. The solved transients of the device provide original indications for increasing the dynamic performance of the system. A 60 kWe commercial unit is tested to validate the model, assessing its nominal and partial load performance. The experimental data confirm the capability of the system to work at partial load without relevant deviations in the stack temperature and pressure. Despite the lower specific consumption of the stack at partial load, the system shows an increase in the average net specific consumptions when the load decreases toward its minimum (from 67 kWhe/kgH2 above 1A/cm2 to 140kWhe/kgH2 at 0.3A/cm2). The simulation results and the experimental data are in good agreement, confirming the prediction capacities of the model with a good accuracy. Among the different investigated operation strategies, the strongest reduction in average net specific consumption at partial load is given by the control of water flowrate to the stack (110 kWhe/kgH2 at 0.3 A/cm2) or of the hydrogen dryer regeneration (70 kWhe/kgH2 at 0.3 A/cm2). These are the suggested points to be investigated for further improvements of fast-changing load systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Crespi","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Guandalini","given":"Giulio"},{"family":"Mastropasqua","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Campanari","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Brouwer","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"crespiExperimentalTheoreticalEvaluation2023","container-title":"Energy Conversion and Management","container-title-short":"Energy Conversion and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116622","ISSN":"0196-8904","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"page":"116622","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Experimental and theoretical evaluation of a 60 kW PEM electrolysis system for flexible dynamic operation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890422014005","volume":"277"},{"id":"CriticalStrategicRaw2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper provides an in-depth examination of critical and strategic raw materials (CRMs) and their crucial role in the development of electrolyzer a…","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.096","ISSN":"0360-3199","language":"en-US","note":"publisher: Pergamon","page":"433-464","source":"www.sciencedirect.com","title":"Critical and strategic raw materials for electrolysers, fuel cells, metal hydrides and hydrogen separation technologies","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036031992401783X","volume":"71","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,19]]},"citation-key":"CriticalStrategicRaw2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"CriticalStrategicRaw2024"},{"id":"cuiTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2023","abstract":"The transformation from a fossil fuels economy to a low carbon economy reshapes how energy is transmitted.

The layers were subjected to a degradation protocol with an upper potential limit of 1.5V. Upon exposure to the degradation protocol particle size increased, the electrochemical areas (ECAs) of the catalysts decreased, the catalytic layers became thinner, and the average pore size decreased, indicating both carbon and Pt corrosion. The relative decrease in the ECA was approximately the same for all three layers and was therefore approximately independent of CCL thickness. For all samples the reaction order with respect to oxygen was one half and the samples showed doubling of the slope of the potential vs. log current curve (dE/dlogi) at high current densities. This indicates that kinetics control the potential at low currents and kinetics and proton migration (ohmic drops in the catalytic layer) at high. However, the degradation protocol also introduced limitations due to oxygen diffusion in the agglomerates. This led to a quadrupling of the dE/dlogi-slope in 13% oxygen in the samples with the highest catalyst area per volume. For the sample with the lowest catalyst area per volume this slope increased by a factor of six in 13% oxygen, indicating that the local current density exceeded that required for the Tafel slope of the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) to double.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Darab","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Barnett","given":"Alejandro Oyarce"},{"family":"Lindbergh","given":"Göran"},{"family":"Thomassen","given":"Magnus Skinlo"},{"family":"Sunde","given":"Svein"}],"citation-key":"darabInfluenceCatalystLayer2017","container-title":"Electrochimica Acta","container-title-short":"Electrochimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.101","ISSN":"0013-4686","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,1]]},"page":"505-516","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Influence of Catalyst Layer Thickness on the Performance and Degradation of PEM Fuel Cell Cathodes with Constant Catalyst Loading","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468617303778","volume":"232"},{"id":"davisParetoAnalysisCritical2014","abstract":"This work presents the results of a Pareto analysis of critical challenges for emerging manufacturing technologies in c-Si photovoltaics.

PCM with H2-uptakes of greater than 5 wt% are urgently required to improve the performance of H2 fuel tanks for use in fuel-cell-powered transportation vehicles. Machine-learning (ML) methods can provide effective tools for predicting PCM H2-uptakes from influential variables determined by experiments performed on a wide range of PCM. This study evaluates the PCM-H2-uptake prediction performance of four well-established ML models: generalized-regression neural network (GRNN), Least-squares-support-vector machine (LSSVM), adaptive-neuro-fuzzy-inference system (ANFIS), and extreme-learning machine (ELM). A 2072-record database, compiled from literature, comprising eleven independent variables and PCM H2-uptake (dependent variable covering a range of 0 to 8.38 wt%) was evaluated by the four ML models. Each model was trained and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The LSSVM generates the best PCM-H2-uptake prediction performance when applied to an independent testing subset of data records, achieving a root mean squared error of just 0.2407 wt%. Feature importance sensitivity analysis identifies pressure as the most influential of the independent variable considered. Leverage analysis identified that 96.53% of the data records of the compiled database, when predicted by the LSSVM model, resided within the applicable domain with only seventy-two data records considered as suspected outliers. These results indicate that the LSSVM model developed is highly generalizable for the purpose of predicting PCM H2-uptake from the influential variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Davoodi","given":"Shadfar"},{"family":"Vo Thanh","given":"Hung"},{"family":"Wood","given":"David A."},{"family":"Mehrad","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Al-Shargabi","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Rukavishnikov","given":"Valeriy S."}],"citation-key":"davoodiMachinelearningModelsPredict2023","container-title":"Separation and Purification Technology","container-title-short":"Separation and Purification Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123807","ISSN":"1383-5866","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"page":"123807","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine-learning models to predict hydrogen uptake of porous carbon materials from influential variables","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586623007153","volume":"316"},{"id":"dawoodHydrogenProductionEnergy2020","author":[{"family":"Dawood","given":"Furat"},{"family":"Anda","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Shafiullah","given":"G M"}],"citation-key":"dawoodHydrogenProductionEnergy2020","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"3847-3869","title":"Hydrogen production for energy: An overview","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213828852","volume":"45"},{"id":"dengApplyingMachineLearning2009","abstract":"This research used two machine leaning methods, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPN), to create the cost prediction models for airplane wing-box structural design, and verified the feasibility and efficiency for both methods.

Therefore, the system is so complex that previous studies could only focus on the optimization of different subsystems of PEMWEs and merely investigate limited variables separately: electrocatalysts, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), single cells, stacks, etc. Therefore, the contributions of traditional research have been limited, and the trial-and-error method adopted to drive the experimental or theoretical studies is inefficient. Reports of applying machine learning (ML) to accelerate the research and development of key materials in PEMWEs have gradually emerged in recent years. The application of ML can greatly accelerate the optimization of different key materials and components in PEMWEs, significantly reducing unacceptably high costs. Therefore, this paper reviews recent applications of ML for material and component optimization in PEMWEs. Moreover, we provide a phased summary and prospects for the future of this emerging field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yawen"},{"family":"Rui","given":"Zhiyan"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yongkang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoke"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xuebin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jianguo"}],"citation-key":"dingMachineLearningUtilized2023","container-title":"Journal of Power Sources","container-title-short":"Journal of Power Sources","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232389","ISSN":"0378-7753","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-20T14:56:53.633Z","page":"232389","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine learning utilized for the development of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775322013660","volume":"556"},{"id":"doeHydrogenShot2020","abstract":"The U.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, or Hydrogen Shot, seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"DoE","given":""}],"citation-key":"doeHydrogenShot2020","container-title":"Energy.gov","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","title":"Hydrogen Shot","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-shot"},{"id":"dontiMachineLearningSustainable2021","author":[{"family":"Donti","given":"Priya L"},{"family":"Kolter","given":"J Zico"}],"citation-key":"dontiMachineLearningSustainable2021","container-title":"Annual Review of Environment and Resources","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"Machine Learning for Sustainable Energy Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:238321691"},{"id":"Downloads","abstract":"We want you to learn more about the project.

The economic performance of the presented approach is compared to a rule-based energy management strategy as a lower benchmark and a Dynamic Programming-based unit commitment as an upper benchmark. The comparative analysis highlights both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the implemented Reinforcement Learning approach. The simulation results indicate a promising potential of Reinforcement Learning-based algorithms for hydrogen production planning, outperforming the lower benchmark. Furthermore, a novel approach in the scientific literature demonstrates that including energy and price forecasts in the Reinforcement Learning observation space significantly improves optimization results and allows the algorithm to take variable prices into account. An unresolved challenge, however, is balancing multiple conflicting objectives in a setting with few degrees of freedom. As a result, no parameterization of the reward function could be found that fully satisfied all predefined targets, highlighting one of the major challenges for Reinforcement Learning -based energy management algorithms to overcome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Dreher","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bexten","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Sieker","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Lehna","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Schütt","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Wirsum","given":"Manfred"}],"citation-key":"dreherAIAgentsEnvisioning2022","container-title":"Energy Conversion and Management","container-title-short":"Energy Conversion and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115401","ISSN":"0196-8904","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,15]]},"page":"115401","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"AI agents envisioning the future: Forecast-based operation of renewable energy storage systems using hydrogen with Deep Reinforcement Learning","title-short":"AI agents envisioning the future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890422001972","volume":"258"},{"id":"duttaPartiallySulfonatedPolyaniline2015","abstract":"Traditionally used Nafion membranes in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) suffer from high methanol permeabilities, as well as, high material costs; therefore, alternative and more efficient polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) materials need to be synthesized in order to realize better cell performances.

This paper comprehensively reviews the most common hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization processes, while their effectiveness is explored from energy, water, economic and environmental perspectives. Their main characteristics, advantages, shortcomings and challenges are discussed as well. The research reveals that the hydrogen's water footprint, energy consumption, carbon emissions, and cost vary significantly depending on the specific technologies used throughout its life cycle, from production to end use. For instance, fossil fuel-based hydrogen production methods, such as steam methane reforming, offer elevated energy performance and cost-effectiveness, but have a significant carbon footprint. In contrast, water electrolysis is environmentally friendly, but requires more water and has lower energy efficiency. Besides, high-pressure containers are the preferred method for hydrogen storage, while liquid and solid storages are better suited for high-energy-density applications. Regarding hydrogen transportation, pipelines are effective over long distances, whereas tankers are convenient for short distances. Furthermore, fuel cells are more energy, carbon and water efficient when using hydrogen as fuel, but they are generally more expensive than internal combustion engines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Elaouzy","given":"Youssef"},{"family":"El Fadar","given":"Abdellah"}],"citation-key":"elaouzyWaterenergycarboncostNexusHydrogen2024","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.114","ISSN":"0360-3199","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"page":"1190-1209","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Water-energy-carbon-cost nexus in hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319923064145","volume":"53"},{"id":"elgowainyAssessmentPotentialFuture2020","abstract":"H2@Scale is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) initiative that brings together stakeholders to advance the affordable production, transport, storage, and utilization of hydrogen (H2) as an energy carrier to increase revenue opportunities in multiple energy sectors. The focus of the current work is to characterize the growth potential of diverse hydrogen industries in the United States, given research and development (R&D) advancements in hydrogen technologies. Current and emerging hydrogen production technologies utilize diverse energy sources, including natural gas (NG) reforming, as well as renewable and nuclear power for low-temperature and high-temperature water splitting. The produced hydrogen also enables emerging domestic industries that value conventional and renewable hydrogen as an energy carrier for intermediate and end use. The success of H2@Scale (Figure ES.1) depends not only on hydrogen demand from growing existing markets such as petroleum refining and ammonia (NH3) production, but also on the development of new markets such as metals refining, synthetic fuel (synfuel) and chemical production, biofuels, light-duty (LD) and heavy-duty (HD) hydrogen fuel cell (FC) electric vehicles (FCEVs), and injection into NG pipelines, all of which can significantly increase hydrogen demand relative to current levels of approximately10 million metric tons [MMT] annually. This study focused primarily on five demand sectors — synfuels, upgrading of oil/biomass, NH3/fertilizer, metals refining, and hydrogen vehicles (transportation) — along with gas infrastructure. For each sector, a hydrogen demand potential was quantified, along with a “threshold price.” The hydrogen demand potential reflects a practical amount of hydrogen that could be used in that sector, barring economic considerations. The threshold price reflects the price at which the consumer would utilize hydrogen in lieu of an alternative that could supply the same performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Elgowainy","given":"Amgad"},{"family":"Mintz","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Uisung"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Pingping"},{"family":"Reddi","given":"Krishna"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Zang","given":"Guiyan"},{"family":"Ruth","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Jadun","given":"Paige"},{"family":"Connelly","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Boardman","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"elgowainyAssessmentPotentialFuture2020","DOI":"10.2172/1710201","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,1]]},"language":"English","number":"ANL-20/35","publisher":"Argonne National Lab.

In order to avoid problem shifting, a life cycle perspective should be applied in the environmental assessment of traction batteries. The aim of this study was to provide a transparent inventory for a lithium-ion nickel-cobalt-manganese traction battery based on primary data and to report its cradle-to-gate impacts. The study was carried out as a process-based attributional life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts were analyzed using midpoint indicators. The global warming potential of the 26.6 kilowatt-hour (kWh), 253-kilogram battery pack was found to be 4.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. Regardless of impact category, the production impacts of the battery were caused mainly by the production chains of battery cell manufacture, positive electrode paste, and negative current collector. The robustness of the study was tested through sensitivity analysis, and results were compared with preceding studies. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the most effective approach to reducing climate change emissions would be to produce the battery cells with electricity from a cleaner energy mix. On a per-kWh basis, cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions of the battery were within the range of those reported in preceding studies. Contribution and structural path analysis allowed for identification of the most impact-intensive processes and value chains.

Various ways of producing and supplying hydrogen have the attention of scientists, companies and policy makers. This study compares the following three ways of green hydrogen production: 1) a photovoltaic system in Africa is used to produce hydrogen from sea water, followed by pipeline transport to Rotterdam, Netherlands, 2) electricity generated by the offshore Borssele 1&2 wind farm in the Netherlands is used for the offshore production of hydrogen from sea water followed by pipeline transport to Rotterdam, or 3) the electricity generated by this offshore wind farm is transmitted to Rotterdam where it is used for onshore production of hydrogen from sea water. The sustainability of the three systems is assessed from a life cycle point of view. The environmental LCA resulted in ReCiPe 2016 endpoint indicators and the midpoint indicators GWP, land use and water consumption. The exergetic sustainability assessment applied the Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) method. The preferred system according to the results of the environmental LCA and the exergetic sustainability assessment is the wind energy system including offshore hydrogen production. The results are not unanimous as to which system is the second-best. The three systems need to be investigated in more detail before firm conclusions can be drawn. It is recommended that attention also be paid to the economic and social pillars of sustainability, and to the exergetic sustainability of technological systems in general, as exergetic assessment results are independent of changing and subjective models, weighting factors and other variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Elmegaard","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Sciubba","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Blanco-Marigorta","given":"Ana M"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Jonas Kjær"},{"family":"Markussen","given":"Wiebke Brix"},{"family":"Meesenburg","given":"Wiebke"},{"family":"Arjomand Kermnai","given":"Nasrin"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Kofler","given":"René"}],"citation-key":"elmegaardProceedingsECOS20222023","DOI":"10.11581/DTU.00000267","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Technical University of Denmark","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Proceedings of ECOS 2022: The 35th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems","title-short":"Proceedings of ECOS 2022","type":"article","URL":"https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/proceedings-of-ecos-2022-the-35th-international-conference-on-eff"},{"id":"erdemirNewSolarEnergybased2022","author":[{"family":"Erdemir","given":"Dogan"},{"family":"Dincer","given":"Ibrahim"}],"citation-key":"erdemirNewSolarEnergybased2022","container-title":"Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"102355-102355","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"A new solar energy-based system integrated with hydrogen storage and heat recovery for sustainable community","type":"article-journal","volume":"52"},{"id":"escobar-yonoffPerformanceAssessmentEconomic2021","author":[{"family":"Escobar-Yonoff","given":"Rony"},{"family":"Maestre-Cambronel","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Charry","given":"Sebastián"},{"family":"Rincón-Montenegro","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Portnoy","given":"Ivan"}],"citation-key":"escobar-yonoffPerformanceAssessmentEconomic2021","container-title":"Heliyon","container-title-short":"Heliyon","ISSN":"2405-8440","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Performance assessment and economic perspectives of integrated PEM fuel cell and PEM electrolyzer for electric power generation","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},{"id":"escobedoDesignConstructionPerformance2023","abstract":"This work presents the design and construction of a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEM-WE) for H2 production.

An electrochemical steady-state and semi-empirical submodel coupled with a lumped thermal capacitance dynamic submodel is developed to predict the stack voltage and the stack temperature evolution from instantaneous operating conditions such as the applied current, the gas storage pressure tanks (H2 and O2) and the ambient temperature. The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to find the electrochemical submodel parameters and a multivariable Matlab-Simulink® linked modular mathematical model is developed for validation. Results indicate that within a temperature range of 20–60 °C, and a pressure range of 15–35 bar, the stack voltage and the temperature evolution can be predicted even in transitory operating phases. The strategy used for the parameters identification is explained in detail and can be applied to any PEM water electrolyzer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Espinosa-López","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Darras","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Poggi","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Glises","given":"Raynal"},{"family":"Baucour","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Rakotondrainibe","given":"André"},{"family":"Besse","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Serre-Combe","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"espinosa-lopezModellingExperimentalValidation2018","container-title":"Renewable Energy","container-title-short":"Renewable Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.renene.2017.11.081","ISSN":"0960-1481","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,1]]},"page":"160-173","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modelling and experimental validation of a 46 kW PEM high pressure water electrolyzer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148117311825","volume":"119"},{"id":"ExtractTableAPIConvert","abstract":"API to extract tables from images, extract tables from PDF without worrying about the table coordinates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"citation-key":"ExtractTableAPIConvert","language":"English","title":"ExtractTable - API to convert image to excel, extract tables from PDF online","type":"webpage","URL":"https://extracttable.com/"},{"id":"facheOptimizationFixedbedMethanation2018","abstract":"Designing and optimizing packed-bed methanation reactors for power-to-gas leads to conflicting issues. Because of the high exothermicity of the reaction, it might be inefficient (low Gas Hourly Space Velocity), or unsafe (runaway, thermal degradation). Dynamically operating reactors are thus particularly difficult to design. In this paper, the behavior of a reactor with multiple catalyst-dilution zones is studied numerically. Simulations of a dynamic sequence (reactor startup) are carried out. The effect of catalyst dilution profile on steady state and transient efficiency is analyzed. We introduce a method to maximize GHSV, while guarantying safe operation during both transient and steady state operation. A proper catalyst dilution profile can increase the steady state efficiency and stability of the reactor. However, the results of the present study show that this dilution profile can have a negative impact on transient efficiency and stability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fache","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Marias","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Guerré","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Palmade","given":"Stéphane"}],"citation-key":"facheOptimizationFixedbedMethanation2018","container-title":"Chemical Engineering Science","container-title-short":"Chemical Engineering Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.ces.2018.08.044","ISSN":"0009-2509","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,31]]},"page":"1124-1137","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Optimization of fixed-bed methanation reactors: Safe and efficient operation under transient and steady-state conditions","title-short":"Optimization of fixed-bed methanation reactors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250918306237","volume":"192"},{"id":"faizLLMCARBONMODELINGENDTOEND2024","abstract":"The carbon footprint associated with large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, encompassing emissions from their training, inference, experimentation, and storage processes, including operational and embodied carbon emissions.

Existing studies have reported the carbon footprint of LLM training, but only one tool, mlco2, can predict the carbon footprint of new neural networks prior to physical training. However, mlco2 has several serious limitations. It cannot extend its estimation to dense or mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, disregards critical architectural parameters, focuses solely on GPUs, and cannot model embodied carbon footprints. Addressing these gaps, we introduce LLMCarbon, an end-to-end carbon footprint projection model designed for both dense and MoE LLMs. Compared to mlco2, LLMCarbon significantly enhances the accuracy of carbon footprint estimations for various LLMs. The source code is released at https://github.com/SotaroKaneda/MLCarbon.","author":[{"family":"Faiz","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Kaneda","given":"Sotaro"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruhan"},{"family":"Osi","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Prateek"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"faizLLMCARBONMODELINGENDTOEND2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"LLMCARBON: MODELING THE END-TO-END CAR- BON FOOTPRINT OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020","abstract":"From a sustainability perspective, a synergy between hydrogen, electricity and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is particularly attractive.

This is no surprise, given the current environment of low demand for oil, growing unease over greenhouse gas emissions, and projections that post-pandemic stimulus measures could do for hydrogen what stimulus measures after the 2008 financial crisis did for solar power. Oil and gas majors have spent tens of millions of dollars on pilot projects, as have other industrial giants. Germany, which has allocated $10 billion to its nascent hydrogen industry, is one of a growing number of governments whose spending to satisfy climate commitments while restarting their economies could provide a major funding kickstart.But for the moment, most analysts agree that the future for a hydrogen economy is still uncertain and that the biggest obstacles to scaling will be costs, technology scaleup, and policy.H2 101 - From Feedstock to FuelHydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all mass. Today approximately 3% of global energy consumption is used to produce hydrogen, at a rate of more than 110 million tons per year, according to BloombergNEF (BNEF). So, hydrogen production is already a large and thriving industry. Yet, according to the Hydrogen Council, only 0.002% of currently produced hydrogen is used as fuel. Some 90% is used for ammonia production, petroleum refining, and methanol production.DNV GL, in a recent report on hydrogen as an energy carrier, describes hydrogen as a unique zero-emission energy carrier that can be converted to electrical energy in a fuel cell two to three times more efficiently than in a combustion engine. Hydrogen as an energy carrier can exist in a variety of forms and can be converted from one form to another, while energy sources such as oil and gas are the original resource from which the energy carrier is produced. Hydrogen can be used as fuel for mobility and heating in buildings; to decarbonize industrial processes; and as price support and storage for excess electricity during periods when production output from renewables alone exceeds demand.BNEF reports in its Hydrogen Economy Outlook that deploying clean hydrogen in the coming decades could reduce up to 34% of global greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and industry at manageable cost. Renewable hydrogen could be produced for $0.70 to $1.60/kg in most parts of the world before 2050 - the equivalent of gas priced at $6-$12/MMBtu, making it competitive with current natural gas prices in Brazil, China, India, Germany, and Scandinavia on an energy-equivalent basis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Feder","given":"Judy"}],"citation-key":"federH2EconomyHype2020","container-title":"Journal of Petroleum Technology","container-title-short":"Journal of Petroleum Technology","DOI":"10.2118/0820-0020-JPT","ISSN":"0149-2136","issue":"08","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"page":"20-23","source":"Silverchair","title":"H2 Economy: Hype, Horizon, or Here?","title-short":"H2 Economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2118/0820-0020-JPT","volume":"72"},{"id":"fengArtificialIntelligencebasedMultiobjective2022","abstract":"Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are promising devices for converting chemical energy into electrical energy due to their versatile properties, such as high power density, quick start-up, lower operating temperature, portability, etc. For PEMFC technology to outperform the incumbent technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) based multi-objective optimisation (AI-MOO) has been employed to facilitate the design and applications of PEMFC since AI-MOO is flexible enough to consider various factors simultaneously in the customized multiple objective functions and under new or updated case situations.

Then, S-GO–SiO2/Nafion proton exchange membranes (PEMs) were prepared via solution casting. S-GO–SiO2 had a good dispersibility inside the membrane matrix. The increased water uptake and the incorporated –SO3H groups bestowed a large increase in proton conductivity upon these composite PEMs. Meanwhile, the barrier effect of two-dimensional S-GO–SiO2 contributed to the obvious reduction in methanol permeability of the composite PEMs, as a result of the increased tortuosity of the transport channels. Therefore, novel S-GO–SiO2/Nafion PEMs with enhanced selectivity (the ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability) were obtained. Even under harsh conditions, such as high methanol concentration and/or increased temperature, the membrane selectivity of S-GO–SiO2/Nafion composite membranes was still nearly two-orders-of-magnitude higher than that of the recast Nafion membrane. It renders this type of composite PEMs a very promising candidate for the application in DMFC.

The Ti and Pt/Ti coatings are characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the coatings are evaluated in simulated and real PEM electrolyser environments, and they managed to fully protect the stainless steel substrate. In contrast, the absence of the thermally sprayed Ti layer between Pt and stainless steel leads to pitting corrosion. The Pt/Ti coating is tested in a PEM electrolyser cell for almost 200 h, exhibiting an average degradation rate of 26.5 μV h−1.

Hydrogen can be used either directly as an energy carrier or as a feedstock for the reduction of CO2 to synthetic hydrocarbons. Hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis, decomposing water in oxygen and hydrogen. This paper presents an overview of the three major electrolysis technologies: acidic (PEM), alkaline (AEL) and solid oxide electrolysis (SOEC). An updated list of existing electrolysers and commercial providers is provided. Most interestingly, the specific prices of commercial devices are also given when available. Despite tremendous development of the PEM technology in the past decades, the largest and most efficient electrolysers are still alkaline. Thus, this technology is expected to play a key role in the transition to the hydrogen society. A detailed description of the components in an alkaline electrolyser and an analytical model of the process are provided. The analytical model allows investigating the influence of the different operating parameters on the efficiency. Specifically, the effect of temperature on the electrolyte conductivity—and thus on the efficiency—is analyzed. It is found that in the typical range of operating temperatures for alkaline electrolysers of 65°C - 220°C, the efficiency varies by up to 3.5 percentage points, increasing from 80% to 83.5% at 65°C and 220°C, respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallandat","given":"Noris"},{"family":"Romanowicz","given":"Krzysztof"},{"family":"Züttel","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"gallandatAnalyticalModelElectrolyser2017","container-title":"Journal of Power and Energy Engineering","DOI":"10.4236/jpee.2017.510003","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,25]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","number":"10","page":"34-49","publisher":"Scientific Research Publishing","source":"www.scirp.org","title":"An Analytical Model for the Electrolyser Performance Derived from Materials Parameters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=79985","volume":"5"},{"id":"ganMultiNetworkCoordinatedHydrogen2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Mingyu"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Jianbo"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Jiakun"},{"family":"Ai","given":"Xiaomeng"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Jinyu"}],"citation-key":"ganMultiNetworkCoordinatedHydrogen2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans. on Ind.

Herein, we suggested a PTL process and a PTL/PTG process combined with the reverse-water-gas-shift (RWGS) and Co-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), which respectively produce liquid hydrocarbons only and the combination of liquid hydrocarbons and high-calorie SNG, based on the previous study regarding the PTL and PTL/PTG processes composed of Fe-based FTS. We conducted the process modelling and comparative techno-economic analysis to determine the key performance of the proposed PTL and PTL/PTG processes including the CO2 mitigation rate, energy efficiency, total product cost and CO2 mitigation cost. The proposed PTL and PTL/PTG processes can be regarded as feasible technical solutions to convert wasted CO2 into high-value liquid hydrocarbons and SNG. Additionally, the indirect PTL and PTL/PTG processes were helpful for improving the production of liquid hydrocarbons.

The electrochemical submodel allows for obtaining the operating stack voltage from the input current and the stack temperature conditions. After non-linear fitting and statistical analysis from experimental data we conclude that the electrochemical submodel can be extrapolated for any PEM water electrolyser knowing two parameters with physical meaning: activation energy of the “water oxidation” for the anode electrocatalyst and the activation energy for proton transport in the solid polymer membrane. This submodel was validated with experimental polarisation curves at different temperatures from two different PEM water electrolysers. The standard error of the model was less than 0.03. The results showed that the worst values of the estimation were obtained below 50 °C, indicating that the assumption of constant anode charge transfer coefficient is not true at lower temperature, which is in accordance with recent results. In order to complete the electrochemical submodel, a practical methodology is presented here to obtain simple semi-empirical submodels for the H2 production and thermal behaviours for this kind of electrolysers.

Therefore, the potential environmental impacts of a greener hydrogen production have been analysed taking the three most important water electrolysis technologies alkaline electrolysis (AEC), polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMEC), and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) into account. To depict a greener hydrogen production, different energy scenarios of Germany –2019, 2030, 2050, and RE (Renewable Energy)– with an increasing share of wind and solar energy have been considered. The study shows how the potential CO2-eq. of a greener hydrogen production change when applying the different energy scenarios for each technology. On the other hand, the study aims to compare the resulting CO2-eq. with comparative values of conventional and other hydrogen production processes for classification purposes. Moreover, the study compares the CO2-eq. results with comparative values of conventional electricity generation and conventional fuels for cars, assuming that the produced hydrogen is used for electricity generation and as a fuel for cars in order to show CO2 reduction potentials. Besides that, the study compares the Life-Cycle-Impact-Assessment (LCIA) indicators under study to show which technology is potentially the most environmentally friendly one for the respective energy scenario. In summary, it can be stated that the CO2-eq. decrease with an increasing share of wind and solar energy in the energy mix since the share of fossil energies, which are the main drivers of the CO2- eq., decline. Furthermore, the SOEC technology has the lowest CO2-eq. for the energy scenarios in 2019, 2030, and 2050. This applies to the AEC technology for the RE scenario. Regarding the comparative values of conventional and other hydrogen production processes as well as conventional alternatives, only the RE scenario with wind and solar energy provides lower results. Thus, merely the RE scenario is suitable for an environmentally friendly hydrogen production and utilization in order to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, the SOEC technology causes the lowest potential environmental impacts for the energy scenarios in 2019 and 2030, taking all LCIA indicators into account. This applies to the PEMEC technology for the energy scenario in 2050 and the RE scenario.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerloff","given":"Niklas"}],"citation-key":"gerloffComparativeLifeCycleAssessmentAnalysis2021","container-title":"Journal of Energy Storage","container-title-short":"Journal of Energy Storage","DOI":"10.1016/j.est.2021.102759","ISSN":"2352-152X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"102759","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparative Life-Cycle-Assessment analysis of three major water electrolysis technologies while applying various energy scenarios for a greener hydrogen production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X21004874","volume":"43"},{"id":"ghadbhanabedMachineLearningAlgorithms2022","abstract":"Machine learning plays a vital role in construction estimation which could make improve the project’s safety, and reliability.

Hydrogen can be produced using a variety of feedstocks and conversion technologies. The feedstock options include water, natural gas, coal, petroleum, methanol, ethanol, biomass, and organic waste streams. Ultimately, using these domestic resources we will be able to produce all the hydrogen we will need for the complete conversion of our transportation infrastructure. The various conversion technologies include electrolysis, reforming (principally of natural gas, but also ethanol and methanol), photobiological and photoelectrochemical, biofermentation, pyrolysis and gasification of biomass and coal, high temperature thermochemical, and catalytic membranes. All of these production technologies are being actively researched by DOE's Office of Hydrogen, Fuel Cells and Infrastructure Technologies (HFCIT); and other offices within DOE support work that complements the HFCIT Program activities. In addition, private industry is also dedicating significant resources to these efforts. In establishing the California Hydrogen Highway Network (CA H2 Net) we must utilize both distributed (that is, hydrogen that is produced at the point of use) as well as centralized production of hydrogen. Because of technical and economic barriers, most of the technologies for hydrogen production listed above will not become practical for either mode of hydrogen production in large quantities until at least the 2015-2030 timeframe. In the near term, that is, the transitional period between now and 2010 when we will establish a widely available hydrogen fueling infrastructure in California, the distributed production options of reforming and electrolysis will play the dominant role. In addition, production of hydrogen at centralized plants using natural gas reforming and delivery of pressurized or liquefied hydrogen by truck will be utilized.

This paper reviews issues raised at a workshop on BECCS, convened in Scotland in late 2009. Presentations by bioenergy and CCS specialists covered topics including the climate policy rationale for BECCS, global biomass CCS potential, the UK potential for BECCS, the risk of fossil fuel lock-in via coal co-firing, and carbon market issues. In practice, the scale of the forestry and accessible CCS infrastructure required are among the obstacles to the large-scale deployment of BECCS in the near term. While biomass co-firing with coal offers an early route to BECCS, a quite substantial (>20%) biomass component may be necessary to achieve negative emissions in a co-fired CCS system. Smaller scale BECCS, through co-location of dedicated or co-combusted biomass on fossil CCS CO2 transport pipeline routes, is easier to envisage and would be potentially less problematic. Hence, we judge that BECCS can, and likely will, play a role in carbon reduction, but care needs to be taken not to exaggerate its potential, given that (i) there are few studies of the cost of connecting bio-processing (combustion, gasification or other) infrastructure with CO2 storage sites and (ii) that scenarios of global bioenergy potential remain contentious. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gough","given":"Clair"},{"family":"Upham","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"goughBiomassEnergyCarbon2011","container-title":"Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/ghg.34","ISSN":"2152-3878","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-14T04:43:37.146Z","page":"324-334","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS or Bio-CCS)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ghg.34","volume":"1"},{"id":"gracaCO2HydrogenationCH42014","abstract":"CO2 hydrogenation into methane was carried out over catalysts containing nickel and cerium species supported on a HNaUSY zeolite, using an H2/CO2 ratio of 4 and temperatures ranging from 250 to 450°C.

A further enhancement of the catalysts performances was noticed when doping the Ni-zeolites catalysts with 3–15% of Ce. Actually, the presence of CeO2 after reduction might promote CO2 activation into CO, the final catalyst properties being due to the synergetic effect between the metal active sites and the promoter. Furthermore, almost no deactivation due to sintering was observed after 10h of reaction at 400°C. Comparing these results with those reported in literature it is possible to conclude that zeolites have great potential to be used as catalyst supports for the CO2 methanation reaction. In fact, taking the commercially available and widely used HNaUSY zeolite, it was possible to reach conversions and selectivities similar to those previously found in the literature for the best CO2 methanation catalysts that use potentially more expensive bulk cerium oxide supports, even without performing any optimization of the zeolite support.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Graça","given":"I."},{"family":"González","given":"L.

A new ohmic loss model of a PEM electrolyzer cell has been developed and the influence of different operating conditions and physical design parameters on its performance has been investigated, including operating temperature, pressure, exchange current density, electrode thickness, membrane thickness and interfacial resistance. The interfacial resistance between the membrane and electrode has been found to play an important part for electrolyzer performance and an overpotential is increased significantly with the interfacial resistance. At a current density of 1.5 A/cm2, the performance loss due to the interfacial resistance between the membrane and electrode comprises 31.8% of the total ohmic loss. Thickness changes in either electrode or membrane also have significant impacts on the electrolyzer performance mainly due to their contributions to the diffusion overpotential and ohmic loss. Increasing the operating temperature will result in lower electrolyzer overpotential, while increasing the operating pressure will lead to higher electrolyzer overpotential, which is mainly controlled by the open circuit voltage. Results obtained from the present model will provide a comprehensive understanding of design parameter effects and consequently improve the design/performance in a PEM electrolyzer cell.","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.03.164","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"22","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","page":"7006-7016","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Electrochemical performance modeling of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cell for hydrogen energy","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036031991500837X","volume":"40","author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Steen","given":"Stuart M."},{"family":"Mo","given":"Jingke"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng-Yuan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,15]]},"citation-key":"hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015","library":"My Library","citekey":"hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015"},{"id":"hanIonExchangeCapacity2021","abstract":"Conventionally, highly proton conductive perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomers are used for an electrolyte membrane in a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer.

At the same time, numerous renewable methanol production pathways are under development, which, if commercialized, could provide significant environmental benefits over traditional methanol synthesis pathways. However, it is difficult to compare technologies at different maturity levels, with differing feedstocks, and with significant differences in overall process design. Thus, there is a need to harmonize the analyses of renewable pathways using a consistent techno-economic approach to evaluate the potential for commercialization of various pathways. This analysis uses a novel cross-comparison method to assess near-term and long-term viability of both low- and high-maturity level technologies. The techno-economic assessment considers cost factors critical to market acceptance combined with carbon- and energy-efficiency assessments of three renewable pathways compared with a commercial baseline. We find that biomass gasification to methanol represents a near-term viable pathway with a high technology readiness level and commercially competitive market price. If cost-reducing technological improvements can be realized and scaled up in the CO2 electrolysis pathways, the potential for higher carbon efficiencies may help drive market adoption of these more modular, direct conversion pathways in future markets as they present an opportunity to better support global decarbonization efforts through efficient waste carbon utilization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Kylee"},{"family":"Grim","given":"R.

Among electrolyzer systems, alkaline and polymer exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are prevalent, with PEM being preferred for large-scale energy storage due to its superior energy efficiency. Therefore, the current development of PEM technology is mainly focused on costs reduction, improvement of performance and durability. However, the degradation at high current densities has not received thorough exploration thus far. In this research, machine learning algorithms were applied to experimental data from commercial PEM water electrolyzers (PEMWE) to examine the impact of various factors including operating temperature, current density, the transport/catalyst layer interface, and catalyst loading. The study focused on how temperature affects three anode catalysts (Ir-black, IrO2 and Ir0.7Ru0.3Ox), the role of pore diameter in the transport layer, and different anode catalyst loadings on cell potential performance. Additionally, the influence of temperature and current density on the degradation of PEMWEs, particularly on the anode side, was analyzed using machine learning techniques. In this study, the machine learning techniques employed were support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The findings indicated that SVR, when its hyper-parameters are fine-tuned using a genetic algorithm (GA), can achieve prediction accuracy comparable to an ANN with a fully connected architecture consisting of two hidden layers, each with 30 nodes. The algorithms’ predictions indicated that PEMWE can be operated at conditions that enhance the performance and life time, subsequently leading to cost reduction in hydrogen ensuring widespread adoption of PEM electrolyzers for hydrogen production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hayatzadeh","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Fattahi","given":"Moslem"},{"family":"Rezaveisi","given":"Ashkan"}],"citation-key":"hayatzadehMachineLearningAlgorithms2024","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.149","ISSN":"0360-3199","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-20T17:49:01.457Z","page":"302-314","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine learning algorithms for operating parameters predictions in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers: Anode side catalyst","title-short":"Machine learning algorithms for operating parameters predictions in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319923064492","volume":"56"},{"id":"hemauerPerformanceCostModelling2023","abstract":"This paper presents a bottom-up approach to the assessment of model performance and costs of a proton-exchange-membrane electrolysis considering cell, stack and process levels. The cell voltage is modelled dependent on current density and detailed models for stack, investment and hydrogen costs are developed. Taking into account current research on PEM electrolysis, such as the use of thinner membranes or low precious metal loading on the electrodes, allows the prediction of next generation's efficiency and costs. By comparison of a current and next-generation PEM electrolysis, the effectiveness of individual development steps was assessed and remaining space for efficiency and cost improvement was identified. This can help to prioritize and to focus on development steps which are most effective. In the next generation, efficiency will be increased even at higher current density operation. Thus, specific stack costs will drop to less than half of present day costs which is decisive to achieve lower hydrogen production costs in the next generation. Specific installed costs and hydrogen production costs of the current and next generation are calculated for plant sizes up to 100 MWDC and reveal significant cost decrease for plant capacities up to 25 MWDC while only changing slightly for capacities larger than this. Costs are always subject to uncertainties due to model assumptions and boundary conditions that need to be defined. Uncertainties and the sensitivities of the model are estimated and assessed to provide an indication of the actual cost range. Main cost model uncertainties are identified to arise from membrane electrode and stack assembly costs, civil engineering and construction surcharge as well as the electrical system. Hydrogen costs are dominated by operating costs and therefore are highly sensitive to the annual operating hours and the electricity price, which have a greater impact on the hydrogen costs than the model assumptions for capital costs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hemauer","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Rehfeldt","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Peschel","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"hemauerPerformanceCostModelling2023","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.050","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"66","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"page":"25619-25634","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Performance and cost modelling taking into account the uncertainties and sensitivities of current and next-generation PEM water electrolysis technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319923010650","volume":"48"},{"id":"hernandez-gomezCellVoltageStaticdynamic2021","abstract":"This article aims to propose and experimentally validate a static-dynamic electrical model of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer.

The complete DMD-MEAs consisted of the membrane-cathode compound assembled with an anode electrode, which is a porous titanium fiber substrate coated with IrO2. Polarization experiments of DMD-MEAs show promising results: In comparison to a reference catalyst coated membrane (CCM) and a porous transport electrode (PTE) type MEA using a freestanding Nafion 117 membrane, we found very good electrochemical performances for DMD-MEAs. DMD-MEAs show slightly higher activation losses than the reference CCM. However, DMD-MEAs seem to exhibit reduced ohmic and mass transport losses compared to those manufactured using the CCM approach. Compared to the PTE-type reference DMD shows improvements for all three loss mechanisms.

However, there are some challenges to be solved yet. One of these challenges is that, right now, the economical competitiveness of electrolysis production strongly depends on the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) availability. This paper analyzes the economic and environmental implications of complementing the power supply of a H2 production plant that usually operates using only RES with grid electricity during the time RES are not available. For performing this analysis, we proposed an assessment model that incorporates Alkaline (ALK) and PEM electrolyzer technology features (such as the low dynamic load range of ALK electrolyzers, which is usually ignored when modeling H2 production). Moreover, we introduce a new metric, named the LCOH&E, which captures the existing trade-off between reducing the Levelized Cost Of Hydrogen (LCOH) with more H2 production using grid electricity and increasing CO2 emissions by producing more H2 with grid electricity. We illustrate the proposed assessment model with a case study based on real data from Chile. Our results show that the optimal fraction of grid electricity to be used in producing H2 may be different when minimizing the LCOH and when minimizing the LCOH&E because of the LCOH-CO2 emissions’ trade off. Moreover, it is remarkable that using only 10% of grid electricity in an ALK electrolyzer, it is possible to increase the H2 production in 25.7%, without significantly increasing the CO2 emission level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hurtubia","given":"Byron"},{"family":"Sauma","given":"Enzo"}],"citation-key":"hurtubiaEconomicEnvironmentalAnalysis2021","container-title":"Applied Energy","container-title-short":"Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117739","ISSN":"0306-2619","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,15]]},"page":"117739","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Economic and environmental analysis of hydrogen production when complementing renewable energy generation with grid electricity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921010849","volume":"304"},{"id":"huttenhainNGlycoproteinSRMAtlas2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hüttenhain","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Surinova","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Ossola","given":"Reto"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"David"},{"family":"Cerciello","given":"Ferdinando"},{"family":"Schiess","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Bausch-Fluck","given":"Damaris"},{"family":"Rosenberger","given":"George"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jingchung"},{"family":"Rinner","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Kusebauch","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Hajdúch","given":"Marián"},{"family":"Moritz","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Wollscheid","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Aebersold","given":"Ruedi"}],"citation-key":"huttenhainNGlycoproteinSRMAtlas2013","container-title":"Molecular & Cellular Proteomics","container-title-short":"Molecular & Cellular Proteomics","DOI":"10.1074/mcp.O112.026617","ISSN":"15359476","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"1005-1016","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"N-Glycoprotein SRMAtlas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535947620311440","volume":"12"},{"id":"Hydrogen","abstract":"The EU's hydrogen strategy and REPowerEU plan have put forward a comprehensive framework to support the uptake of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen to help decarbonise the EU.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,5]]},"citation-key":"Hydrogen","language":"en","title":"Hydrogen","type":"webpage","URL":"https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-systems-integration/hydrogen_en"},{"id":"HydrogenCarbonIntensity","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,22]]},"citation-key":"HydrogenCarbonIntensity","title":"Hydrogen Carbon Intensity Calculator","type":"webpage","URL":"https://hypec.gti.energy/"},{"id":"HydrogenPosturePlan","citation-key":"HydrogenPosturePlan","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Hydrogen Posture Plan: An Integrated Research, Development and Demonstration Plan","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"HydrogenProductionWater","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,18]]},"citation-key":"HydrogenProductionWater","title":"Hydrogen Production From Water Electrolysis: Current Status and Future Trends | IEEE Journals & Magazine | IEEE Xplore","type":"webpage","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5898382?casa_token=GVWXuCD89pQAAAAA:9U1KN_CKEGXLHuYM7I96SbfhCo_IjvBHEP5N5EwcnZ-Po8mvdktOyE_VpIGvs0grlkpvlrAM"},{"id":"HydrogenShot","abstract":"The U.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, or Hydrogen Shot, seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,5]]},"citation-key":"HydrogenShot","container-title":"Energy.gov","language":"en","title":"Hydrogen Shot","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-shot"},{"id":"ibn-mohammedArtificialIntelligenceMachine2023","abstract":"The application of functional materials and devices (FM&Ds) underpins numerous products and services, facilitating improved quality of life, but also constitutes a huge environmental burden on the natural ecosystem, prompting the need to quantify their value-chain impact using the bottom-up life cycle assessment (LCA) framework.

The high energy content, flexibility, and abundance of this chemical element are reasons why many sectors can benefit from it in the so-called hydrogen economy. However, almost all hydrogen produced today comes from fossil fuels (mostly from natural gas via steam methane reforming) and has a high associated carbon footprint. Hydrogen production from more environmentally friendly sources has been an area of intensive research for the last years. A necessity to categorize the hydrogen production paths became inevitable. It began by assigning green and gray “colors” to hydrogen to distinguish between a “nonpolluting” hydrogen production and one with associated carbon dioxide emissions. The definition of green hydrogen is now widely understood as hydrogen produced from water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources. However, other energy sources could power electrolysis and produce hydrogen with no carbon dioxide emissions, e.g., nuclear energy. In the need to differentiate between the source of hydrogen and the production process, many different colors to refer to each path started to appear in the literature. There is no universal agreement upon a color code for hydrogen. This paper gives an overview of the commonly assigned colors. It also compares their environmental impact, production cost, and other parameters. Finally, the authors propose a color code with the most common colors gathered from the literature that could be useful in a large-scale hydrogen economy. Green hydrogen is expected to become the most popular production method and economically competitive with natural gas prices by 2050.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Incer-Valverde","given":"Jimena"},{"family":"Korayem","given":"Amira"},{"family":"Tsatsaronis","given":"George"},{"family":"Morosuk","given":"Tatiana"}],"citation-key":"incer-valverdeColorsHydrogenDefinitions2023","container-title":"Energy Conversion and Management","container-title-short":"Energy Conversion and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117294","ISSN":"0196-8904","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"page":"117294","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"“Colors” of hydrogen: Definitions and carbon intensity","title-short":"“Colors” of hydrogen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890423006404","volume":"291"},{"id":"informaticsWelcomeNISTWebBook","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Informatics","given":"NIST Office of Data","dropping-particle":"and"}],"citation-key":"informaticsWelcomeNISTWebBook","language":"en","publisher":"National Institute of Standards and Technology","title":"Welcome to the NIST WebBook","type":"webpage","URL":"https://webbook.nist.gov/"},{"id":"InnovationOutlookRenewable","citation-key":"InnovationOutlookRenewable","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Innovation Outlook: Renewable Methanol","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"InnovationOutlookRenewable2021","abstract":"Methanol is essential for the chemical industry.

Our continuously growing energy demand is driven by extensive growth in economic development and population and places an ever-increasing burden on fossil fuel utilization that represent a substantial percentage of this increasing energy demand but also creates challenges associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resource depletion. Such challenges make the global transition obligatory from conventional to renewable energy sources. Hydrogen is emerging as a new energy vector outside its typical role and receiving more recognition globally as a potential fuel pathway, as it offers advantages in use cases and unlike synthetic carbon-based fuels can be truly carbon neutral or even negative on a life cycle basis. This review paper provides critical analysis of the state-of-the-art in blue and green hydrogen production methods using conventional and renewable energy sources, utilization of hydrogen, storage, transportation, distribution and key challenges and opportunities in the commercial deployment of such systems. Some of the key promising renewable energy sources to produce hydrogen, such as solar and wind, are intermittent; hydrogen appears to be the best candidate to be employed for multiple purposes blending the roles of fuel energy carrier and energy storage modality. Furthermore, this study offers a comparative assessment of different non-renewable and renewable hydrogen production systems based on system design, cost, global warming potential (GWP), infrastructure and efficiency. Finally the key challenges and opportunities associated with hydrogen production, storage, transportation and distribution and commercial-scale deployment are addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ishaq","given":"Haris"},{"family":"Dincer","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Curran"}],"citation-key":"ishaqReviewHydrogenProduction2022","collection-title":"SI: Progress in Hydrogen Production, Storage and Distribution (Ahmadi)","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.149","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"62","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,22]]},"page":"26238-26264","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A review on hydrogen production and utilization: Challenges and opportunities","title-short":"A review on hydrogen production and utilization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319921045377","volume":"47"},{"id":"itoEffectFlowRegime2010","abstract":"The flow characteristics of circulating water in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer were experimentally evaluated using a small cell and two-phase flow theory.

Hydrogen, an important input of the system, is supplied by biomass gasification and water electrolysis driven by renewable energy. Integrated system of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines supplies the required electricity of the system. An oxygen-steam mix is utilized as the gasification agent. An ion transport membrane is employed for oxygen production as an alternative to an expensive and complicated air separation unit. A comprehensive thermodynamic and economic analysis of the system is carried out. All equipment and ancillary costs are considered. Since solid carbon generation can lead to deactivation of the methanation reactor catalysts, the potential for solid carbon generation is considered for practicality. Multi-objective optimizations of different scenarios, are performed to determine the optimal economical and technical performance of the system. The optimization results indicate that the minimum cost for producing synthetic natural gas is 0.28 $/kWh. Furthermore, the heating value of synthetic natural gas is 41,500 kJ/kg, which closely approximates that of natural gas. Additionally, the price of the produced synthetic natural gas is lower than the price of natural gas in certain countries.

However, the green hydrogen production cost is still more expensive than fossil fuel-based methods such as steam methane reforming and it is the biggest challenge. In this study, to determine the most economical way to obtain green hydrogen, a technoeconomic analysis was performed on four different water electrolysis technologies, that is, alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEC), solid oxide electrolysis with electric heaters (SOEC (E.H)), and solid oxide electrolysis combined with a waste heat source (SOEC (W.H)). It is assumed that the SOEC (W.H) system is linked to the adjacent power plant and receives waste heat. The net present value calculation, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo method were performed for the 4 cases presented above.

The analysis results show that the SOEC (W.H) has the most competitive case due to sensible heat energy saving and higher stack efficiency.

Furthermore, a brief comparison between the methods is made to identify the pros and cons of current technologies.","author":[{"family":"Jara-Cobos","given":"Lourdes"},{"family":"Abril-González","given":"Mónica"},{"family":"Pinos-Vélez","given":"Verónica"}],"citation-key":"jara-cobosProductionHydrogenLignocellulosic2023","container-title":"Catalysts","DOI":"10.3390/catal13040766","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"title":"Production of Hydrogen from Lignocellulosic Biomass: A Review of Technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4344/13/4/766","volume":"13"},{"id":"javedRoleOxygenRegulation2022","abstract":"One of the biggest challenges for hydrogen (H2) production via biophotolysis is the sensitivity of the process to oxygen (O2), which is the primary inhibitor of the hydrogenase enzyme responsible for H2 production. The present study reviews the literature on methods to enhance H2 production by creating suitable conditions to enable the activity of the hydrogenase enzyme. Techniques studied include the regulation of available O2 and utilizations of antioxidants. Furthermore, optimizing algal growth parameters such as pH, temperature, light intensity, and cell density can keep the algal cells alive for a more extended period for biophotolysis and can directly or indirectly activate enzymatic activity for enhanced H2 production. Various O2 regulating techniques, i.e., mineral deprivation, oxygen-reducing agents/scavengers, co-culturing of microalgae with bacteria, the addition of antioxidants and nanoparticles have been analyzed and discussed in this review. Analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats/challenges (SWOT) also presents the limitations and advantages of H2 production via biophotolysis. This review insights that employing all the favorable techniques with suitable operating parameters simultaneously can result in enhanced H2 yield and better process sustainability. However, O2 regulating techniques such as co-culturing with bacteria and the use of antioxidants/nanoparticles appear to be the most significant in H2 production via biophotolysis towards environmental sustainability and green energy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Javed","given":"Muhammad Asad"},{"family":"Zafar","given":"Abdul Mannan"},{"family":"Aly Hassan","given":"Ashraf"},{"family":"Zaidi","given":"Asad A."},{"family":"Farooq","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"El Badawy","given":"Amro"},{"family":"Lundquist","given":"Tryg"},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Mohamad Mostafa Ahmed"},{"family":"Al-Zuhair","given":"Sulaiman"}],"citation-key":"javedRoleOxygenRegulation2022","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering","container-title-short":"Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.jece.2021.107003","ISSN":"2213-3437","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,1]]},"note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-14T04:50:06.001Z","page":"107003","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The role of oxygen regulation and algal growth parameters in hydrogen production via biophotolysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343721019801","volume":"10"},{"id":"jeffersIntegrationResilienceGoals","author":[{"family":"Jeffers","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Wachtel","given":"Amanda M"},{"family":"Zhivov","given":"Alexander M"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Calum B"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Avinash"},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Patrick W"}],"citation-key":"jeffersIntegrationResilienceGoals","language":"en","note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-19T18:28:21.427Z","source":"Zotero","title":"Integration of Resilience Goals into Energy Master Planning Framework for Communities","type":"article-journal","volume":"126"},{"id":"jiangChallengesDevelopmentReversible2016","author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"San Ping"}],"citation-key":"jiangChallengesDevelopmentReversible2016","container-title":"Asia-Pacific Journal of Chemical Engineering","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"386-391","title":"Challenges in the development of reversible solid oxide cell technologies: a mini review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:102239349","volume":"11"},{"id":"jiangMachineLearningBased2023","abstract":"This work evaluated the practicability and economy of the enhanced weathering (EW)-based CO2 capture in series packed bubble column (S-PBC) contactors operated with different process configurations and conditions. The S-PBC contactors are designed to fully use the advantages of abundant seawater and highly efficient freshwater through a holistic M4 model, including multi-physics, machine learning, multi-variable and multi-objective optimisation. An economic analysis is then performed to investigate the cost of different S-PBC configurations. A data-driven surrogate model based on a novel machine learning algorithm, extended adaptive hybrid functions (E-AHF), is implemented and trained by the data generated by the physics-based models. GA and NSGA-II are applied to perform single- and multi-objective optimisation to achieve maximum CO2 capture rate (CR) and minimum energy consumption (EC) with the optimal values of eight design variables. The R2 for the prediction of CR and EC is higher than 0.96 and the relative errors are lower than 5%. The M4 model has proven to be an efficient way to perform multi-variable and multi-objective optimisation, that significantly reduces computational time and resources while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The trade-off of the maximum CR and minimum EC is presented by the Pareto front, with the optimal values of 0.1014 kg h−1 for CR and 6.1855 MJ kg−1CO2 for EC. The calculated net cost of the most promising S-PBC configuration is around 400 $ t−1CO2, which is about 100 $ t−1CO2 lower than the net cost of current direct air capture (DAC), but compromised by slower CO2 capture rate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Hai"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuo"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Pinfield","given":"Valerie J."},{"family":"Xuan","given":"Jin"}],"citation-key":"jiangMachineLearningBased2023","container-title":"Energy and AI","container-title-short":"Energy and AI","DOI":"10.1016/j.egyai.2023.100234","ISSN":"2666-5468","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"page":"100234","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine learning based techno-economic process optimisation for CO2 capture via enhanced weathering","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266654682300006X","volume":"12"},{"id":"jiangPhotoelectrochemicalDevicesSolar2017","author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Chaoran"},{"family":"Moniz","given":"Savio J A"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Aiqin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Junwang"}],"citation-key":"jiangPhotoelectrochemicalDevicesSolar2017","container-title":"Chemical Society Reviews","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"4645-4660","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","title":"Photoelectrochemical devices for solar water splitting–materials and challenges","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},{"id":"jiaoPerfectingElectrocatalystsImperfections2021","author":[{"family":"Jiao","given":"Shilong"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Xianwei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuangyin"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"jiaoPerfectingElectrocatalystsImperfections2021","container-title":"Energy & Environmental Science","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"1722-1770","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","title":"Perfecting electrocatalysts via imperfections: towards the large-scale deployment of water electrolysis technology","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},{"id":"joComparativeAnalysisCircular2020","abstract":"End plates are located at both ends of a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) stack.

The commercialization of large PEME systems, however, requires improvements to electrode design, performance, and reduction of material costs. In particular, reducing the precious metal loading at the oxygen producing electrode (anode) is critical to making PEME commercially competitive.\nMeasuring the electrode potentials separately is imperative to understanding and improving cell performance. A reliable reference electrode (RE) can provide much more precise information about the anode performance. A RE was developed for PEME application. The efficacy of the RE was confirmed by two parametric studies. The first parametric study served to demonstrate that the combined individual electrode potentials measured with the RE were exactly consistent with the overall potential difference of the cell. A second parametric study confirmed sufficient hydrogen polarization of the RE for operating conditions at low current density, low temperature, and low water feed rates.\nApplication of the RE was successfully demonstrated through investigation of the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction mechanisms occurring at the anode and cathode, respectively. Tafel slopes were calculated and the rate determining steps were determined that support specific proposed reaction mechanisms reported in literature. This investigation revealed important characteristics of each electrode. In particular, it was shown that the cathode overvoltage should not be assumed negligible for the ohmic controlled operating region and more precise information can be observed for the anode performance. These results demonstrate the necessity of the in-situ RE to improving PEME performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston-Haynes","given":"Elyse"}],"citation-key":"johnston-haynesReferenceElectrodeDevelopment","event-place":"Canada -- Ontario, CA","genre":"M.A.Sc.","ISBN":"9798662401143","language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"102","publisher":"Queen's University (Canada)","publisher-place":"Canada -- Ontario, CA","source":"ProQuest","title":"Reference Electrode Development in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) Electrolyzer Assembly for Novel Investigation of Electrodes","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2035297713/abstract/91768E095DCE44E3PQ/1"},{"id":"johnstonAppliedUnsupervisedLearning2019","abstract":"Design clever algorithms that can uncover interesting structures and hidden relationships in unstructured, unlabeled dataKey FeaturesLearn how to select the most suitable Python library to solve your problemCompare k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and non-parametric methods and decide when to use themDelve into the applications of neural networks using real-world datasetsBook DescriptionUnsupervised learning is a useful and practical solution in situations where labeled data is not available.

Optimal prediction and process optimization could be one of the most substantial SCUI of GHP. Machine learning (ML)-based prediction and optimization of GHP technologies from water industries for a circular economy (CRE) could be a plausible solution for these SCUI. We studied a detailed techno-economic and environmental feasibility study, which recommended proton exchange membrane (PEM) and dark fermentation (DF) as the most promising and environment-friendly technologies for GHP. Thus, the present investigation aims to apply different ML models to predict and optimize the GHP of DF and PEM technologies to solve the SCUI. The results revealed K-nearest neighbor and random forest are the best-fitted models to predict GHP for DF and PEM, correspondingly based on the regression co-efficient (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MEA). The permutation variable index (PVI) recommended that chemical oxygen demand (COD), butyrate, temperature, pH and acetate/butyrate ratio are the most influential process parameters in decreasing order for DF, while temperature, cell areas, cell pressure, cell voltage and catalysts loadings are the most effective process parameters for PEM in reducing order. The partial dependency analysis (PDA) demonstrated GHP increases with increasing COD values up to 10 mg/L, and the optimal temperature range in the DF process is between 25 and 30 °C. On the other hand, cell temperature up to 35 °C should be considered optimum for PEM, and 40–70 cm2 cell areas could produce a significant GHP. In summary, the present study underscores the potential of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) as promising techniques for optimizing GHP, ultimately addressing scaling-up challenges in large-scale industrial GHP production and ensuring a sustainable hydrogen economy (HE).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kabir","given":"Mohammad Mahbub"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Sujit Kumar"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Faisal"},{"family":"Nam","given":"Sang Yong"},{"family":"Im","given":"Kwang Seop"},{"family":"Tijing","given":"Leonard"},{"family":"Shon","given":"Ho Kyong"}],"citation-key":"kabirMachineLearningbasedPrediction2023","container-title":"Desalination","container-title-short":"Desalination","DOI":"10.1016/j.desal.2023.116992","ISSN":"0011-9164","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"page":"116992","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine learning-based prediction and optimization of green hydrogen production technologies from water industries for a circular economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916423006240","volume":"567"},{"id":"kagkouraBifunctionalNanostructuredPalladium2023","abstract":"Bifunctional Electrocatalysts Article 2200518 by Nikos Tagmatarchis and co-workers shows that the optimized MoSx@Pd is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction and exhibits outstanding performance and stability as cathode electrocatalyst in a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kagkoura","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Karamoschos","given":"Nikolaos"},{"family":"Perivoliotis","given":"Dimitrios K."},{"family":"García","given":"Alexis Piñeiro"},{"family":"Gracia-Espino","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Tasis","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Tagmatarchis","given":"Nikos"}],"citation-key":"kagkouraBifunctionalNanostructuredPalladium2023","container-title":"Advanced Sustainable Systems","DOI":"10.1002/adsu.202370017","ISSN":"2366-7486","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH","page":"2370017","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Bifunctional Nanostructured Palladium/MoSx Electrocatalyst for Cathode Hydrogen Evolution Reaction PEM Water Electrolysis and Oxygen Reduction Reaction (Adv.

Compared with conventional water electrolysis, anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis with its low cost and high performance is a promising technology. To identify the feasibility of the large-scale process application of AEM, performance verification and economic analysis based on a high-fidelity model are essential. This study presents a first-principles-based model and feasibility study results for a 10 MW AEM water electrolysis system. The cost differences between the key components of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and AEM electrolysis processes were identified using a breakdown cost estimation approach for the polymer membrane water electrolysis process. In terms of catalyst and stack costs, AEM is approximately 36.2% and 25.9% less expensive than PEM, respectively. The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) for AEM water electrolysis process was analyzed based on wind and solar electricity, and the future potential of the technology was discussed. As technological advances improve the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), water electrolysis stack lifetime, and renewable energy efficiency, the LCOH of AEM and PEM processes are expected to improve significantly in the future. In particular, AEM water electrolysis would be highly attractive if AEM stack lifetime is developed to the same level as that of PEM.","container-title":"Energy Conversion and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.enconman.2024.118134","ISSN":"0196-8904","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Conversion and Management","page":"118134","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-economic analysis of anion exchange membrane electrolysis process for green hydrogen production under uncertainty","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019689042400075X","volume":"302","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Minsu"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Donggyun"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Junghwan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"citation-key":"kimTechnoeconomicAnalysisAnion2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"kimTechnoeconomicAnalysisAnion2024"},{"id":"klimenkoMETHANATIONTECHNOLOGIESPRODUCING2022","abstract":"Methanation, or the generation of synthetic methane through the combination of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, has been attracting more and more attention of researchers and energy scientists in recent years due to the fact that the development of an effective and economically feasible technology for the implementation of this process will allow solving a number of energy and environmental problems. First, it is the accumulation of excess renewable electricity from solar and wind power plants by using it in the creation of another energy-intensive product, namely synthetic natural gas, which removes the problem of coordinating unstable sources of electricity with energy networks. Secondly, methanation becomes another technology for enriching biogas and turning it into biomethane, which will allow it to be used through existing gas networks and contribute to solving the problem of natural gas shortage.\nThe development and improvement of methanation technologies are engaged in many organizations of the world - Germany, Denmark, France, the USA, Japan and others. Research is conducted in two main directions: catalytic methanation and biological methanation. In the first direction, methanation is carried out through the Sabatier reaction using catalysts. The problems of such methanation are: the development of catalysts with high activity, selectivity and resistance to the heat of reaction, the provision of optimal reaction modes, in particular temperature and pressure, through the use of various methods of reactor cooling, control of the reaction mechanism, the use of three-phase reactors, changing their structure, and so on. Biological methanation is carried out using of biological methanogens - so-called archaea, which act as a kind of catalyst. The methanation is carried out either directly in the biomass anaerobic digestion reactor (in-situ methanation) or in a separate reactor into which biogas and hydrogen are fed separately (ex-situ methanation). One of the main problems of in-situ methanation is the simultaneous provision of optimal conditions for both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. This problem is solved by ex-situ methanation, in which the optimal conditions for anaerobic digestion and methanation processes are provided separately. It is clear that optimal conditions are also provided for biomethanation of pure CO2 and H2, when the «broth» for archaea is created separately. A comparison of catalytic and biological methanation technologies shows that catalytic methanation provides higher energy efficiency and requires much smaller reactor sizes than biological methanation for the same methane yield. However, the latter has a higher resistance to harmful impurities than the catalytic one.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Klimenko","given":"V.

To achieve performances and lifetimes competitive with proton exchange membrane or liquid alkaline electrolyzers, however, improvements in the integration of materials into the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) are needed. In particular, the integration of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, ionomer, and transport layer in the anode catalyst layer has significant impacts on catalyst utilization and voltage losses due to the transport of gases, hydroxide ions, and electrons within the anode. This study investigates the effects of the properties of the OER catalyst and the catalyst layer morphology on performance. Using cross-sectional electron microscopy and in-plane conductivity measurements for four PGM-free catalysts, we determine the catalyst layer thickness, uniformity, and electronic conductivity and further use a transmission line model to relate these properties to the catalyst layer resistance and utilization. We find that increased loading is beneficial for catalysts with high electronic conductivity and uniform catalyst layers, resulting in up to 55% increase in current density at 2 V due to decreased kinetic and catalyst layer resistance losses, while for catalysts with lower conductivity and/or less uniform catalyst layers, there is minimal impact.

Research and progress on PFSAs, especially when considered with their applications, are at the forefront of bridging electrochemistry and polymer (physics), which have also opened up development of state-of-the-art in situ characterization techniques as well as multiphysics computation models. Topics reviewed stem from correlating the various physical (e.g., mechanical) and transport properties with morphology and structure across time and length scales. In addition, topics of recent interest such as structure/transport correlations and modeling, composite PFSA membranes, degradation phenomena, and PFSA thin films are presented.

To account for two-phase flow, the volume of fluid (VOF) method in ANSYS Fluent 17.2 is used. The modelled geometry consists of the anode channels and the anode transport layer (ATL). To reduce the complexity of the phenomena governing PEMEC operation, the dependence upon electro-chemistry is disregarded. Instead, a fixed source of the gas is applied at the interface between the ATL and the catalyst layer. An important phenomenon that the model is able to capture is the gas–liquid contact angle on both the channel wall and ATL-channel interface. Particularly, the latter interface is crucial in capturing bubble entrainment into the channel. To validate the numerical simulation, photos taken of the gas–liquid flow in a transparent micro-channel, are qualitative compared against the simulation results. The experimental observations confirm the models prediction of long Taylor bubbles with small bubbles in between. From the simulation results, further intriguing details of the flow are revealed. From the bottom to the top of the outgoing channel, the film thickness gradually increases from zero to 200 μm. This increase in the film thickness is due to the particular superficial velocity field that develops in an interdigitated flow. Here both the superficial velocities change along the length of the channel. The model is capable of revealing effect of different bubble shapes/lengths in the outgoing channel. Shape and the sequence of the bubbles affect the water flow distribution in the ATL. The model presented in this work is the first step in the development of a comprehensive CFD model that comprises multiphase flow in porous media and micro-channel, electro-chemistry in catalyst layers, ion transport in membrane, hydrogen evolution, etc. The model can aid in the study of gas–liquid flow and its impact on the performance of a PEMEC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Lafmejani","given":"Saeed Sadeghi"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Anders Christian"},{"family":"Kær","given":"Søren Knudsen"}],"citation-key":"lafmejaniVOFModellingGas2017","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.05.079","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,29]]},"page":"16333-16344","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"VOF modelling of gas–liquid flow in PEM water electrolysis cell micro-channels","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319917319493","volume":"42"},{"id":"laguna-berceroRecentAdvancesHigh2012","abstract":"New and more efficient energy conversion systems are required in the near future, due in part to the increase in oil prices and demand and also due to global warming.

A biomethane production cost of 0.47 €/Nm3 was calculated, while the minimum biomethane selling price for NPV = 0 was equal to 0.66 €/Nm3, considering a H2 price of 1.0 €/kg. The feasibility analysis indicated that the H2-related costs were the major contributor to the capital and operation costs due to high expenses associated with the in-situ H2 storage facility and the purchasing of H2, respectively. Compared to conventional upgrading methods, biological biogas upgrading has a higher capital and production cost, which can be reduced by increasing the plant capacity.

An optimized ratio of catalyst loading between the anode and cathode with a fixed Pt catalyst loading according to the DOE target is figured out by conducting diverse electrochemical measurements with varying the catalyst loading ratio in single-cells.

Power to gas (PtG) technologies, especially Power to methane has been deemed as one of the promising pathways for the conversion of CO2 into valuable gaseous fuel. Many reports have reviewed the academic literature related to CO2 methanation. While the benefits of high temperature methanation for overall process efficiency are well understood, the potential for low-temperature methanation is less understood. In particular the opportunities that arise from coupling a low-temperature methanation process with low temperature hydrogen production technologies, such as PEM electrolysis, have received little attention. It is therefore considered valuable to provide a critical review of the state of the art of this technology at low temperature conditions for the interests of broader research community. In this paper we focus on the recent work around low temperature CO2 methanation including reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, catalyst materials including supports and promoters, and suitable reactor technologies. We discuss each of these critical aspects of the technology and identify key challenges and opportunities for low temperature CO2 methanation (methanation conducted at temperatures less than 300 °C).

Different data-driven models are compared with the proposed surrogate model Finally, the optimal combination of the structural and operating parameters that maximize the power density is obtained based on the above optimization framework. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other models, where the mean absolute percentage error and coefficient of determination on the testing set are 0.68 % and 0.999, respectively. The maximum power density obtained is 0.704 W/cm-2, with a relative error of only 0.325 % to the three-dimensional model results. This work provides a useful guide for the optimization of the fuel cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Hong-Wei"},{"family":"Qiao","given":"Bin-Xin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jun-Nan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Wenxuan"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Guo-Long"}],"citation-key":"liDatadrivenFrameworkPerformance2022","container-title":"Energy Conversion and Management","container-title-short":"Energy Conversion and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116338","ISSN":"0196-8904","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-20T17:53:25.768Z","page":"116338","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A data-driven framework for performance prediction and parameter optimization of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890422011165","volume":"271"},{"id":"liDevelopmentVariousMachine2024","abstract":"Biorefining biological waste to produce eco-friendly fuels and by-products is essential in transitioning from non-renewable energies.

A common approach to optimizing revenues of a hybrid hydro and energy storage system is using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Although MILP models can provide accurate production cost estimations, they are typically very computationally expensive. To provide a fast yet accurate first-step information to hydropower plant owners or operators who consider integrating energy storage systems, we propose an innovative approach to predicting optimal revenues of an integrated energy generation and storage system. In this study, we examined the performance of two prediction techniques: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and machine learning (ML) models developed based on artificial neural networks (ANN). Predictive equations and models are generated based on optimized solutions from a market participation optimization model, the Conventional Hydropower Energy and Environmental Resource System (CHEERS) model. The two predicting techniques reduce the computational time to evaluate annual revenue for one set of battery configurations from 3 h to 1 to 4 min per run while also being implementable with significantly less data. The model validation prediction errors of developed GAMs and ML models are generally below 5%; for model testing predictions, the ML models consistently outperform the regression equations in terms of root mean square errors. This new approach allows plant owners, operators, or potential investors to quickly access multiple battery configurations under different energy generation and market scenarios. This new revenue prediction method will therefore help reduce the barriers, and thereby promoting the deployment of battery hybridization with existing renewable energy sources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Yingqian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Binghui"},{"family":"Moiser","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Griffel","given":"L.

However, a rigorous examination of the interplay between the hydrogen economy and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is imperative. This study addresses this imperative by comprehensively assessing the risks associated with hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and utilization. The overarching aim is to establish a robust framework that ensures the secure deployment and operation of hydrogen-based technologies within the UK’s sustainable development trajectory. Considering the unique characteristics of the UK’s energy landscape, infrastructure, and policy framework, this paper presents practical and viable recommendations to facilitate the safe and effective integration of hydrogen energy into the UK’s SDGs. To facilitate sophisticated decision making, it proposes using an advanced Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) tool, incorporating regret theory and a 2-tuple spherical linguistic environment. This tool enables a nuanced decision-making process, yielding actionable insights. The analysis reveals that Incident Reporting and Learning, Robust Regulatory Framework, Safety Standards, and Codes are pivotal safety factors. At the same time, Clean Energy Access, Climate Action, and Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure are identified as the most influential SDGs. This information provides valuable guidance for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and regulators. It empowers them to make well-informed strategic decisions and prioritize actions that bolster safety and sustainable development as the UK transitions towards a hydrogen-based energy system.

However, the production, transportation, and refueling of hydrogen are more energy- and emissions-intensive compared to gasoline. A well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and emissions analysis was conducted to compare a HFCEV (Toyota Mirai) with a gasoline conventional ICEV (Mazda 3). Two sets of specific fuel consumption data were used for each vehicle: (1) fuel consumption derived from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) window-sticker fuel economy figure, and (2) weight-averaged fuel consumption based on physical vehicle testing with a chassis dynamometer on EPA's five standard driving cycles. The WTW results show that a HFCEV, even fueled by hydrogen from a fossil-based production pathway (via steam methane reforming of natural gas), uses 5%–33% less WTW fossil energy and has 15%–45% lower WTW greenhouse gas emissions compared to a gasoline conventional ICEV.

The prototypical case is that of anion-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs), where addition of an alkali metal solution improves performance. However, the specific mechanism of this performance improvement is currently unknown. This work investigates the functionality of the alkali metal solution in AEMWEs using experiments and mathematical models. The results show that additional hydroxide plays a key role not only in ohmic resistance of the membrane and catalyst layer but also in the reaction kinetics. The modeling suggests that the added liquid electrolyte creates an additional electrochemical interface with the electrocatalyst that provides ion-transport pathways and distributes product gas bubbles; the total effective electrochemical active surface area in the cell with 1 M KOH is 5 times higher than that of the cell with DI water. In the cell with 1 M KOH, more than 80% of the reaction current is associate with the liquid electrolyte. These results indicate the importance of high pH of electrolyte and catalyst/electrolyte interface in AEMWEs. The understanding of the functionality of the alkali metal solution presented in this study should help guide the design and optimization of AEMWEs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiangjin"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Zhenye"},{"family":"Li","given":"Dongguo"},{"family":"Pak","given":"Magnolia"},{"family":"Alia","given":"Shaun M."},{"family":"Fujimoto","given":"Cy"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yu Seung"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Adam Z."}],"citation-key":"liuElucidatingRoleHydroxide2021","container-title":"Journal of The Electrochemical Society","container-title-short":"J.

The work demonstrated that the catalyst loading affects the sensitivity of electrolysis performance to PTL properties, particularly those of the PTL surface in contact with the CL. It was demonstrated that upon reducing catalyst loading, PTL properties had an increased effect on the performance of PEMWE cells. While we observed mild performance variations among PTLs when using a high anode catalyst loading, strong correlations between PTL surface properties and cell performance existed at a low catalyst loading. PTL properties affected performance by influencing the in-plane conductivity and permeability of the CL. The variation of apparent exchange current density and apparent CL bubble coverage with the stoichiometric flow rate was studied at low anode feed rates. This led to the emergence of a PTL grain size effect on apparent bubble coverage at high catalyst loading. We provide a descriptive analysis of the phenomena causing voltage losses in PEMWE devices.

Ideally, cost estimators should rely on several statistical models concurrently, as their distinct characteristics yield complementary views on the drivers of manufacturing cost. Finally, some engineering insights revealed by the statistical analysis are presented. They include the ranking and quantification of the most important cost drivers, the approximation of the economic production function of component cost according to accumulated production volume and a different view on the traditional breakdown of manufacturing cost of some jet engine components.

In this study, we therefore develop global time series gridded data of annual synthetic N and P fertilizer use rate in agricultural lands, matched with HYDE 3.2 historical land use maps, at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° latitude–longitude during 1961–2013.

Considering cropland expansion, the increase in total fertilizer consumption is even larger. Hotspots of agricultural N fertilizer application shifted from the US and western Europe in the 1960s to eastern Asia in the early 21st century.

In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties.

Two types of anode flow-field designs were investigated, the single serpentine flow-field (SSFF) and parallel flow-field (PFF). The results show that the PFF design yielded a higher cell performance than the SSFF design at identical operating conditions. Optical visualization shows a strong relationship between the flow path length and the length of gas slugs produced, which in turn influences the flow regime of operation. Longer flow path length in the SSFF results in annular flow regime at a high current density which degrades cell performance. The annular flow regime was absent in the PFF design.

TCM provides cost and performance boundaries that assist in prioritizing R&D efforts. As a case study, we describe a Technical‐Economic Cost model for Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs). The model is fine‐tuned to a range of materials, compositions and fabrication processes in order to inform the materials design in view of ease of fabrication, cost, integration and performance of new generation of fuel cell components.","author":[{"family":"Malek","given":"Kourosh"}],"citation-key":"malekAssessingMaterialsInnovation2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Assessing materials innovation with technical-economic cost models","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"malekDataDrivenFrameworkAccelerated2021","abstract":"Searching for next-generation electrocatalyst materials for electrochemical energy technologies is a time-consuming and expensive process, even if it is enabled by high-throughput experimentation and extensive first-principle calculations.

However, hydrogen is generally produced through polluting and energy–intensive processes such as steam methane reforming and coal gasification. The benefit of steam methane reforming is that it is a well–established and inexpensive process with a production cost in the 1–2.4 USD/kgH2 range. Hydrogen can also be generated through water electrolysis powered by renewables. This mode of production is costly with a levelized cost of hydrogen of 3–8 USD/kgH2 due to the expensive membrane–electrode assemblies used in conventional electrolyzers. Membraneless electrolyzers remove these membrane–electrode assemblies altogether achieving separation of the generated gases fluid–mechanically. Despite the potential economic benefits of this technology, a techno–economic analysis of these devices is still missing; this article aims to bridge the gap in the literature. Several scenarios, including the source of electricity (renewables vs. grid), plant size, technological maturity, carbon tax level, and location are examined. Membraneless electrolyzers have a levelized cost of hydrogen of around 2USD/kgH2, rivaling steam reforming and showing far higher profitability than conventional electrolyzer technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Manzotti","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Quattrocchi","given":"Emanuele"},{"family":"Curcio","given":"Antonino"},{"family":"Kwok","given":"Stephen C.

This research analyses the techno-economic potential of waste heat recovery from multi-MW scale green hydrogen production. A 10 MW proton exchange membrane electrolysis process is modelled with a heat recovery system coupled with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to drive the mechanical compression of hydrogen. The technical results demonstrate that when implementing waste heat recovery coupled with an ORC, the first-law efficiency of electrolyser increases from 71.4% to 98%. The ORC can generate sufficient power to drive the hydrogen's compression from the outlet pressure at the electrolyser 30 bar, up to 200 bar. An economic analysis is conducted to calculate the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of system and assess the feasibility of implementing waste heat recovery coupled with ORC. The results reveal that electricity prices dominate the LCOH. When electricity prices are low (e.g., dedicated offshore wind electricity), the LCOH is higher when implementing heat recovery. The additional capital expenditure and operating expenditure associated with the ORC increases the LCOH and these additional costs outweigh the savings generated by not purchasing electricity for compression. On the other hand, heat recovery and ORC become attractive and feasible when grid electricity prices are higher.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"María Villarreal Vives","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruiqi"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Sumit"},{"family":"Smallbone","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"mariavillarrealvivesTechnoeconomicAnalysisLargescale2023","container-title":"Applied Energy","container-title-short":"Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121333","ISSN":"0306-2619","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,15]]},"page":"121333","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-economic analysis of large-scale green hydrogen production and storage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261923006979","volume":"346"},{"id":"MarketsSingleMINING","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,11]]},"citation-key":"MarketsSingleMINING","title":"Markets single - MINING.COM","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.mining.com/markets/commodity/nickel/"},{"id":"marzoukLevelizedCostGreen2023","abstract":"The techno-economic analysis/assessment (TEA) tool H2A-Lite (Hydrogen Analysis Lite Production) of the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is applied for computing the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) in the Sultanate of Oman, in the case of utilizing polymer electrolyte membranes (or proton exchange membranes, PEM) in combination with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems.

The author then discusses component testing and assembly of a hand-portable mobile phone product. PCB manufacturing, final assembly and product testing must form an integral part of the design process.

With the increased interest in a hydrogen (H2) economy, the life-cycle environmental performance of H2 production has special significance for assisting in identifying opportunities to improve environmental performance and to guide challenging decisions and select between technology paths. Life cycle impact assessment methods are rapidly evolving to analyze multiple environmental impacts of the production of products or processes. This study marks the first step in developing process-based streamlined life cycle analysis (LCA) of several H2 production pathways combining life cycle impacts at the midpoint (17 problem-oriented) and endpoint (3 damage-oriented) levels using the state-of-the-art impact assessment method ReCiPe 2016. Steam reforming of natural gas, coal gasification, water electrolysis via proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM), solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC), biomass gasification and reforming, and dark fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass were analyzed. An innovative aspect is developed in this study is an analysis of water consumption associated with H2 production pathways by life-cycle stage to provide a better understanding of the life cycle water-related impacts on human health and natural environment. For water-related scope, Water scarcity footprint (WSF) quantified using Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) method was applied as a stand-alone indicator. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each production pathway, identify the drivers of environmental impact, quantify midpoint environmental impact and its influence on the endpoint environmental performance.

Moreover, very low emission systems can be developed using a combination of hydrogen energy technologies and renewable energy systems. However, renewable energy shows certain irregularities as a fact of its very nature. However, an energy source that is not affected by irregularities is quite possible using electricity produced from renewable energy in production and storage of hydrogen. At this point, the predictability of a country's energy sources is vital when investing in stable energy systems. In this study, the hydrogen production values of a PEM electrolyser (PEM-E), as supported by GaAs Photovoltaic (GaAsPV) technology, are estimated using data from a meteorological station with high solar energy potential. The observed and predicted solar radiation values constitute the main dataset. Daily radiation estimations are achieved via an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Logic Inference System (ANFIS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Empirical Angström-Prescott (EAP), and Agnostic Deep Learning (DL) models.

The models predict eleven different parameters of the cell components for four different input parameters such as hydrogen production rate, cathode area, anode area, and the type of cell design (e.g., single or bipolar). The models fit well as we trained multiple machine learning models on 148 samples and validated the model performance on a test set of 16 samples. The average accuracy of the classification model and the mean absolute error is 83.6% and 6.825, respectively, which indicates that the proposed technique performs very well. We also measured the hydrogen production rate using a custom-made PEM electrolyzer cell fabricated based on the predicted parameters and compared it to the simulation result. Both results are in excellent agreement and within a negligible experimental uncertainty (i.e., a mean absolute error of 0.615). Finally, optimal PEM electrolyzer cells for commercial-scaled hydrogen production rates ranging from 500 to 5000 mL/min were designed using the machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to model the PEM design problem with such large parameter predictions using machine learning with those specific input parameters. This study opens the route for providing a form of technology that can greatly save the cost and time required to develop water electrolyzer cells for future hydrogen production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Amira"},{"family":"Ibrahem","given":"Hatem"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Kibum"}],"citation-key":"mohamedOptimizationProtonExchange2022","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en15186657","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"18","page":"6657","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Optimization of Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer Cell Design Using Machine Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/18/6657","volume":"15"},{"id":"mohantaImpactMembraneTypes2020","abstract":"Performance of a low temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is highly dependent on the kind of catalysts, catalyst supports, ionomer amount on the catalyst layers (CL), membrane types and operating conditions.

In addition, in situations of global crisis like the current one, it is a key tool to avoid being dependent on natural gas exported from other countries. That is why the European Union has set a production target of 10 million tons of green hydrogen per year by 2030. As recently as May 2022 the European Union signed a pact with European electrolyser manufacturers in order to reach this target as rapidly as possible. There are many ways of producing hydrogen, natural gas/coal reforming, biomass pyrolysis, but all of them involve the production or capture of carbon dioxide, in some way, water electrolysis being the most efficient way to obtain hydrogen without greenhouse gas emissions, in addition, water electrolysis has great synergies with renewable energies. This article is based on the study of the different parameters that affect the efficiency of the electrolysis process, focusing on the operating temperature control. A temperature management system has been proposed to maintain the stack at the desired operating point. The real electrical consumption data during the operation of an electrolyser under different ambient temperatures have been studied. Real evidence has been found regarding the relationship between external temperature and the efficiency of the electrolyser, leading to a more in-depth analysis to obtain efficiency correction curves based on the ambient operating temperature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Molina","given":"P."},{"family":"Rios","given":"C."},{"family":"Martinez de Leon","given":"C."},{"family":"Brey","given":"J.

One such solution is developing clean hydrogen. This unique fuel has the potential to minimize climate change impacts, helping decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry and global transport, while also promoting energy security, sustainable growth, and job creation. The authors estimate suggest that hydrogen needs to grow seven-fold to support the global energy transition, eventually accounting for ten percent of total energy consumption by 2050. A scaleup of this magnitude will increase demand for materials, such as aluminum, copper, iridium, nickel, platinum, vanadium and zinc to support hydrogen technologies - renewable electricity technologies and the electrolyzers for renewable hydrogen, carbon storage for low-carbon hydrogen, or fuel cells using hydrogen to power transport. This report, a joint product of the World Bank and the Hydrogen Council, examines these three critical areas. Using new data on the material intensities of key technologies, the report estimates the amount of critical minerals needed to scale clean hydrogen. In addition, it shows how incorporating sustainable practices and policies for mining and processing materials can help minimize environmental impacts. Key among these approaches is the use of recycled materials, innovations in design in order to reduce material intensities, and adoption of policies from the Climate Smart Mining (CSM) Framework to reduce impacts to greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Moreira","given":"Susana"},{"family":"Laing","given":"Timothy James"}],"citation-key":"moreiraSufficiencySustainabilityCircularity2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en_US","publisher":"Washington, DC: World Bank","source":"openknowledge.worldbank.org","title":"Sufficiency, Sustainability, and Circularity of Critical Materials for Clean Hydrogen","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://hdl.handle.net/10986/38413"},{"id":"motzPerformanceDurabilityAnion2021","abstract":"Over the last decade, several stable anion exchange polymer electrolytes have been developed for electrochemical devices.

At power matched conditions, solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 18–21% with a production rate of 0.8–1.0 L/(min-m2module area) of H2 was obtained using concentrated PV modules (~28–30% efficiency). Conventional Si module (~17.5% efficiency), on the other hand, generated about 0.3 L/(min-m2module area) of H2 Average with a STH Average of 9.4%. While scaling up of the electrolyzers by increasing the size of their electrodes resulted in a similar voltage losses due to mismatching of their power point with that of PV modules (when coupled without power electronics), scaling them out in series maximizes H2 production by utilizing the maximum power available from PV. Unlike, PV-electrolysis operated via power electronics, direct integration of PV modules with electrolyzers leads to effective utilization of PV power, with STH values closer to the theoretical limit of the coupled system (STH = PV module efficiency × Electrolyzer efficiency). The H2 production rate and STH using a concentrated system with a solar tracker remained constant and high during the measurement period (5–6 h). On the other hand, the production rate as well as STH varied with time on a conventional Si module without a tracker under 1 sun, with a significantly low average H2 production rate.

Conventional technologies do face severe drawbacks in reducing carbon emissions. Carbon neutrality is considered as the most essential concept as it can alleviate the issues of greenhouse gas emissions while deriving energy and fuels from fossil origin. Several reduction technologies are proposed in the recent past, in which the integration of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind power are signified. The review aims to provide an understanding of the technology transition to attain carbon neutrality through production of carbon-free energies such as hydrogen and bioenergy. Despite the chemical and physical sequestration methods, the biological sequestration technique is given special attention for the mitigation of CO2 emissions by utilizing photosynthetic microalgae. Of numerous microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris, a common eukaryotic microalga found in freshwater showed a maximum CO2 fixation rate of about 3.35 g/L/d with 10 % CO2 input. Apart from capturing and storing carbon in the geological site, the concept of utilizing and converting carbon into valuable byproducts is described elaborately. The possibilities for utilizing renewable energy sources for carbon-free energy production through unique prototypes are reviewed and elaborated. It mainly aids to utilize renewable resources more than conventional, which significantly minimizes the carbon footprint. The integration of bioenergy, carbon capture and storage concepts with renewable energy sources extends opportunities to minimize emissions and transition towards carbon neutrality and indeed can aid in achieving carbon negativity. The aforementioned concept was reported to produce about 12.5 million tons ton of hydrogen with 133 million tons of CO2 recovery. An innovative prototype to resolve emission issues other than CO2 was also addressed.

The in situ dispersion of Pd was reflected through a continuous increase of rWGS activity over 92 h and supported by kinetic analysis, infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopies and scanning transmission electron microscopy.

The production of carbon neutral synthetic fuels is primarily driven by the need to decouple the energy sector from fossil fuels dependance which are the main source of environmental issues. Hydrogen (H2) produced from water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity and direct carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the flue gas generated by power plants, industry, transportation, and biogas production from anaerobic digestion, are used to convert electricity into carbon-neutral synthetic fuels. These fuels function as effective energy carriers that can be stored, transported, and used in other energy sectors (transport and industry). In addition, the PtF concept is an energy transformation that is capable of providing services for the balancing of the electricity grid thanks to its adaptable operation and long-term storage capacities for renewable energy surplus. As a consequence, it helps to potentially decarbonize the energy sector by reducing the carbon footprint and GHG emissions. This paper gives an overview on recent advances of renewable PtF technology for the e-production of three main hydrogen-based synthetic fuels that could substitute fossil fuels such as power-to-methane (PtCH4), power-to-methanol (PtCH3OH) and power-to-ammonia (PtNH3). The first objective is to thoroughly define in a clear manner the framework which includes the PtF technologies. Attention is given to green H2 production by water electrolysis, carbon capture & storage (CCS), CO2 hydrogenation, Sabatier, and Haber Bosch processes. The second objective is to gather and classify some existing projects which deal with this technology depending on the e-fuel produced (energy input, conversion process, efficiency, fuel produced, and application). Furthermore, the challenges and future prospects of achieving sustainable large-scale PtF applications are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Nemmour","given":"Amira"},{"family":"Inayat","given":"Abrar"},{"family":"Janajreh","given":"Isam"},{"family":"Ghenai","given":"Chaouki"}],"citation-key":"nemmourGreenHydrogenbasedEfuels2023","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.240","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"75","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"page":"29011-29033","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Green hydrogen-based E-fuels (E-methane, E-methanol, E-ammonia) to support clean energy transition: A literature review","title-short":"Green hydrogen-based E-fuels (E-methane, E-methanol, E-ammonia) to support clean energy transition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319923013393","volume":"48"},{"id":"ngStateofArtDevelopmentNafionBased2022","abstract":"Nafion, a perfluorosulfonic acid proton exchange membrane (PEM), has been widely used in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) to serve as a proton carrier, methanol barrier, and separator for the anode and cathode. A significant drawback of Nafion in DMFC applications is the high anode-to-cathode methanol fuel permeability that results in over 40% fuel waste. Therefore, the development of a new membrane with lower permeability while retaining the high proton conductivity and other inherent properties of Nafion is greatly desired. In light of these considerations, this paper discusses the research findings on developing Nafion-based membranes for DMFC. Several aspects of the DMFC membrane are also presented, including functional requirements, transport mechanisms, and preparation strategies. More importantly, the effect of the various modification approaches on the performance of the Nafion membrane is highlighted. These include the incorporation of inorganic fillers, carbon nanomaterials, ionic liquids, polymers, or other techniques. The feasibility of these membranes for DMFC applications is discussed critically in terms of transport phenomena-related characteristics such as proton conductivity and methanol permeability.

As of yet, long-term durability is a core issue to be resolved for the mass production of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that requires varied research in the range from sustainable materials to the optimal operating strategy. The capacity to accurately estimate performance degradation is critical for developing reliable and durable PEMFCs. This review investigates various PEMFC performance degradation modeling techniques, such as model-based, data-driven, and hybrid models. The pros and cons of each approach are explored, as well as the challenges in adequately predicting performance degradation. Physics-based models are capable of simulating the physical and electrochemical processes which occur in fuel cell components. However, these models tend to be computationally demanding and can vary in terms of parameters between different studies. On the other hand, data-driven models provide rapid and accurate predictions based on historical data, but they may struggle to generalize effectively to new operating conditions or scenarios. Hybrid prediction approaches combine the strengths of both types of models, offering improved accuracy but also introducing increased computational complexity to the calculations. The review closes with recommendations for future research in this area, highlighting the need for more extensive and accurate prediction models to increase the reliability and durability of PEMFCs for fuel cell electric vehicles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Huu-Linh"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sang-Min"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Sangseok"}],"citation-key":"nguyenComprehensiveReviewDegradation2023","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en16124772","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"12","page":"4772","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Comprehensive Review of Degradation Prediction Methods for an Automotive Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/12/4772","volume":"16"},{"id":"nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022","abstract":"Perfluorinated-sulfonic-acid-based ionomers (PFSAs) are still the material of choice for electrochemical energy devices such as proton-exchange membrane fuel cells or water electrolyzers.

The potential of integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) with machine learning has been highlighted in recent studies. This hybrid framework is valuable not only for assessing food supply chains but also for improving them toward a more sustainable system. Yet, an essential step in the optimization process is defining the optimization boundaries, or minimum and maximum quantities for the variables. Usually, the boundaries for optimization variables in these studies are obtained from the minimum and maximum values found through interviews and surveys. A deviation in these ranges can impact the final optimization results. To address this issue, this study applies the Delphi method for identifying variable optimization boundaries. A hybrid environmental assessment framework linking LCA, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, the Delphi method, and genetic algorithm was used for optimizing the pomegranate production system. The results indicated that the suggested framework holds promise for achieving substantial mitigation in environmental impacts (potential reduction of global warming by 46%) within the explored case study.

Integrative omics research provides a strong platform to understand the basic biology and translate this knowledge into sustainable solutions in tackling disease outbreak, increasing productivity thus ensuring food security. To further understand the complex biology of host-pathogen response and support the aquaculture effort, genome and proteome reference maps moving beyond simple sequence information of cultivated fish species will accelerate research and translation of quality products for food industries. Towards this end, we have performed an extensive proteomics-based investigation of Labeo rohita, one of the economically important fish species produced in world aquaculture. Deep proteomic profiling of 17 histologically normal tissues, plasma and embryo provided mass-spectrometric evidence for 6015 high confident canonical proteins at 1% false discovery rate. Tissue enriched expression of several biologically important proteins was validated using targeted proteomics with high quantitative accuracy.

It foregrounds the importance of assessing the environmental consequences of hydrogen-generating processes for their long-term viability. The article compares several hydrogen production processes in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and technical improvements. It also investigates the environmental effects of each approach, considering crucial elements such as greenhouse gas emissions, water use, land needs, and waste creation. Different industrial techniques have distinct environmental consequences. While steam methane reforming is cost-effective and has a high production capacity, it is coupled with large carbon emissions. Electrolysis, a technology that uses renewable resources, is appealing but requires a lot of energy. Thermochemical and biomass gasification processes show promise for long-term hydrogen generation, but further technological advancement is required. The research investigates techniques for improving the environmental friendliness of hydrogen generation through the use of renewable energy sources. Its ultimate purpose is to offer readers a thorough awareness of the environmental effects of various hydrogen generation strategies, allowing them to make educated judgements about ecologically friendly ways. It can ease the transition to a cleaner hydrogen-powered economy by considering both technological feasibility and environmental issues, enabling a more ecologically conscious and climate-friendly energy landscape.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Nnabuife","given":"Somtochukwu Godfrey"},{"family":"Darko","given":"Caleb Kwasi"},{"family":"Obiako","given":"Precious Chineze"},{"family":"Kuang","given":"Boyu"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xiaoxiao"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"nnabuifeComparativeAnalysisDifferent2023","container-title":"Clean Technologies","DOI":"10.3390/cleantechnol5040067","ISSN":"2571-8797","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"4","page":"1344-1380","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Comparative Analysis of Different Hydrogen Production Methods and Their Environmental Impact","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2571-8797/5/4/67","volume":"5"},{"id":"noweGeneticAlgorithms2011","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowé","given":"Ann"}],"citation-key":"noweGeneticAlgorithms2011","container-title":"Encyclopedia of Astrobiology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-11274-4_629","editor":[{"family":"Gargaud","given":"Muriel"},{"family":"Amils","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Quintanilla","given":"José Cernicharo"},{"family":"Cleaves","given":"Henderson James (Jim)"},{"family":"Irvine","given":"William M."},{"family":"Pinti","given":"Daniele L."},{"family":"Viso","given":"Michel"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-642-11274-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"635-639","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"Springer Link","title":"Genetic Algorithms","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-11274-4_629"},{"id":"obaraEconomicPerformanceSOFC2023","abstract":"As the deployment of renewable energies increases, the development of power sources needed to adjust the supply–demand balance plays an important role. This study investigates a solid oxide fuel cell combined cycle (SOFC-CC) system with carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) that adopts green hydrogen methanation of stored CO2. The proposed system has high power generation efficiency and does not contribute to global warming because the CO2 emitted during operation is captured after separation, stored in carbon capture and storage, and converted into a synthetic fuel by methanation. However, because the economic feasibility of SOFC-CC with CCUS is unknown, the discounted cash flow method, which is used in the Projected Cost of Generating Electricity report, is used in this study. For a scenario with a 750 MW rated output, 25 MW photovoltaic capacity, and 3% discount rate at a unit electricity sales price of 0.36 USD/kWh, the simple integration balance, net present value, and dynamic payback periods are 9, 10, and 12 years, respectively.

Its coupling with renewable electrical sources involves some issues related to the intermittent operation of PEM electrolysis systems. Within this framework, modelling is an essential tool to understand these issues, provide a thorough analysis and suggest some design optimization. A bibliographic analysis was carried out to identify existing models. State of the art highlighted that, although it is critical for the conception of such systems, only a few models take into account the dynamic of the whole system including balance of plant. Therefore, in this paper a new dynamic and multiphysic model of a proton exchange membrane electrolysis system is presented. It was first developed under a graphical modelling formalism: the bond graphs (BG). Regarding dynamic and multiphysic modelling of complex systems, the BG have many advantages: it involves four levels of modelling using only one tool; it is a unified multiphysic approach; the parameters used have a physical meaning; the BG model can be refined very easily by adding new elements without having to start again the modelling process. Finally, because of its causal and structural properties, BG is suitable for modelling but also for control, sizing and diagnosis analysis. The model was then transcribed systematically into block diagrams in modular fashion for reutilisability of model libraries components. After a validation process, the model was proved to describe accurately the dynamic behaviour of a semi-industrial PEM electrolysis system (25 kW). The dynamic model can now be used to achieve some analyses through BG structural properties and simulations. Thus, it is a powerful tool to improve the design of PEM electrolysis systems powered by intermittent electrical sources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Olivier","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Bourasseau","given":"Cyril"},{"family":"Bouamama","given":"Belkacem"}],"citation-key":"olivierDynamicMultiphysicPEM2017","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.002","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"page":"14872-14904","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dynamic and multiphysic PEM electrolysis system modelling: A bond graph approach","title-short":"Dynamic and multiphysic PEM electrolysis system modelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036031991730839X","volume":"42"},{"id":"olivierLowtemperatureElectrolysisSystem2017","abstract":"This review provides an exhaustive and comprehensive analysis of the existing modelling works about low temperature electrolysis system: alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM) technologies.

These assessments involve time-consuming and expensive experiments aimed at determining the yield of the process. In this study, a machine learning method is utilized as a toolbox and is coupled with simulation to save time and money by omitting the above-mentioned experiments for techno-economic and life cycle assessment. The bio-oil yield in the pyrolysis process is predicted using the artificial neural network (ANN) model based on both ultimate and proximate analyses of the biomass and temperature of the pyrolysis process from the literature review. For tuning the ANN model, a semi-auto-tuning method was developed. The results show the high predictability of the model with an R2 of 0.81 for unseen data. Following this, a new process of upgrading organic solid waste using natural gas is simulated using the Aspen Plus software to determine the material and energy balances. According to the economic evaluation, using natural gas significantly reduces the minimum selling price (MSP) of renewable diesel. In this study, $3.5/gal is the minimum selling price, which is 22% lower compared to similar plants in other literature reviews. A Monte Carlo simulation was also performed to investigate the uncertainty, and the results indicated that, with a probability of 50%, the net present value (NPV) is greater than the NPV calculated deterministically. Based on the results of the life cycle assessment, the newly proposed process emits 66% less amount of greenhouse gases than other commercial processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Omidkar","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Alagumalai","given":"Avinash"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhaofei"},{"family":"Song","given":"Hua"}],"citation-key":"omidkarMachineLearningAssisted2024","container-title":"Applied Energy","container-title-short":"Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122321","ISSN":"0306-2619","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"page":"122321","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine learning assisted techno-economic and life cycle assessment of organic solid waste upgrading under natural gas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261923016859","volume":"355"},{"id":"ondaPerformanceAnalysisPolymerElectrolyte2002","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Performance Analysis of Polymer-Electrolyte Water Electrolysis Cell at a Small-Unit Test Cell and Performance Prediction of Large Stacked Cell , Kazuo Onda, Toshio Murakami, Takeshi Hikosaka, Misaki Kobayashi, Ryouhei Notu, Kohei Ito","container-title":"Journal of The Electrochemical Society","DOI":"10.1149/1.1492287","ISSN":"1945-7111","issue":"8","journalAbbreviation":"J.

The type of alcohol (methanol, ethanol, propanols) and water-to-alcohol ratio were varied to determine their influence on membrane swelling, dispersion quality, and coatability. Small-scale coating samples were prepared to understand coating uniformity and formation of irregularities. Subsequently, two water/1-propanol ratios (90:10 and 75:25) were down-selected for R2R slot-die coating. The R2R catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) coating process increased catalyst layer production throughput by over 500x compared to our standard lab-scale spray coating. The CCMs obtained from this process were tested as single-cell membrane electrode assemblies. They exhibited a cell voltage of 1.91 V at a current density of 2 A/cm2, which is comparable to spray-coated CCMs. In conclusion, the work presented here demonstrates a continuous, scalable manufacturing process that eliminates the need for the decal-transfer step typically used in CCM production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Janghoon"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Zhenye"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Ulsh","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Mauger","given":"Scott A."}],"citation-key":"parkRolltorollProductionCatalyst2020","container-title":"Journal of Power Sources","container-title-short":"Journal of Power Sources","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228819","ISSN":"0378-7753","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,15]]},"note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-19T03:13:56.835Z","page":"228819","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Roll-to-roll production of catalyst coated membranes for low-temperature electrolyzers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877532031123X","volume":"479"},{"id":"patrickfarleyAzureAIContent2024","abstract":"Learn how Azure AI Content Safety encrypts your data when it's persisted to the cloud.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"PatrickFarley","given":""}],"citation-key":"patrickfarleyAzureAIContent2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,28]]},"language":"en-us","title":"Azure AI Content Safety Service encryption of data at rest - Azure AI services","type":"webpage","URL":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/how-to/encrypt-data-at-rest"},{"id":"peighambardoustReviewProtonExchange2010","abstract":"Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered to be a promising technology for clean and efficient power generation in the twenty-first century. Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are the key components in fuel cell system. The researchers have focused to reach the proton exchange membrane with high proton conductivity, low electronic conductivity, low permeability to fuel, low electroosmotic drag coefficient, good chemical/thermal stability, good mechanical properties and low cost. These are classified into the “iron triangle” of performance, durability, and cost. Current PEMFC technology is based on expensive perflourinated proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) that operate effectively only under fully hydrated conditions. There is considerable application-driven interest in lowering the membrane cost and extending the operating window of PEMs. PEMFC system complexity could be reduced by the development of ‘water-free’ electrolytes that do not require hydration. It also enables the PEMFC to be operated under ‘warm’ conditions (i.e. above 100 °C) thus further improving its efficiency. Capital cost could also be further reduced because at warmer conditions less Pt could be used. This paper presents an overview of the key requirements for the proton exchange membranes (PEM) used in fuel cell applications, along with a description of the membrane materials currently being used and their ability to meet these requirements. A number of possible alternative candidates are reviewed and presented in this paper. Also discussed are some of the new materials, technologies, and research directions being pursued to try to meet the demanding performance and durability needs of the PEM fuel cell industry. The alternative PEMs are classified into three categories: (1) modified Nafion® composite membranes; (2) functionalized non-fluorinated membranes and composite membranes therein; and (3) acid–base composite membranes. Several commonly used inorganic additives are reviewed in the context of composite membranes. Finally, the general methods of the measuring and evaluating of proton exchange membrane properties have been investigated such as proton conductivity, ion exchange capacity, water uptake, gas permeability, methanol permeability, durability, thermal stability and fuel cell performance test.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Peighambardoust","given":"S.

Processes, issues and practical difficulties are discussed with academic and applied efforts presented in parallel. It is emphasized that most of the ongoing research related to the direct processes is at the exploratory stage while technology utilizing indirect approach has advanced to semi-works and initial commercialization plants. The new emerging processes based on partial oxidation features are unique for syngas generation. Further enhancement of such processes plus improvements in other second generation technologies and advances in direct processes are anticipated to provide additional, new attractive paths to the chemical conversion of natural gas. Similarly, on board generation of hydrogen-rich gaseous fuels either for spark ignition engines or for coupled-fuel-cells electric engines is discussed within the scope of both partial oxidation and catalytic decomposition of methanol. A concept based in the thermochemical water splitting, which provides a renewable portable fuel from water in the form of H2, is also presented.

However, its operation efficiency is highly dependent on the usage of expensive noble metals as electrocatalysts. Replacing, decreasing, or simply extending the operational lifetime of these precious metals have a positive impact on the hydrogen economy. Mo-based electrocatalysts are often praised as potential materials to replace the Pt used at the cathode to catalyse the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Most electrocatalytic studies are performed in traditional three-electrode cells with different operational conditions than those seen in PEM systems, making it difficult to predict the expected material’s performance under industrially relevant conditions. Therefore, we investigated the viability of using three selected Mo-based nanomaterials (1T′-MoS2, Co-MoS2, and β-Mo2C) as HER electrocatalysts in PEMWE systems. We investigated the effects of replacing Pt on the catalyst loading, charge transfer resistance, kinetics, operational stability, and hydrogen production efficiency during the PEMWE operation. In addition, we developed a methodology to identify the individual contribution of the anode and cathode kinetics in a PEMWE system, allowing to detect the cause behind the performance drop when using Mo-based electrocatalysts. Our results indicate that the electrochemical performance in three-electrode cells might not strictly predict the performance that could be achieved in PEMWE cells due to differences in interfaces and porosity of the macroscopic catalyst layers. Among the catalysts studied, 1T′-MoS2 is truly an excellent candidate to replace Pt as an HER electrocatalyst due to its low overpotential, low charge transfer resistance, and excellent durability, reaching a high efficiency of ∼75% at 1 A cm–2 and 1.94 V.

This requires achieving carbon neutrality shortly after 2050. In the United States, industrial emissions represent 22% of greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly hard to decarbonize, because (1) the processes emit CO2 as a byproduct of chemical reactions and (2) these industries require high-grade heat input. This study focuses on some of these industries, namely cement, lime, glass, and steelmaking. This work details the incumbent kiln and furnace technologies and explores the developing processes with examples of existing projects that aim to reduce carbon emissions, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), fuel switching, and other technological changes. We provide tools to evaluate the most appropriate low-carbon solutions at existing facilities and on new-build infrastructure while taking into account the local context and resources. This paper highlights two states within the U.S. with a high concentration of cement, lime, glass, and steelmaking facilities, California and Pennsylvania. The emissions from cement, lime, and glass facilities in California total 8.5 MtCO2eq/yr. About 6.3 MtCO2/yr (7.1% of in-state industrial emissions) could be captured from cement and lime facilities, transported, and stored in sedimentary basins below the Central Valley. Replacing 20% of coal by biomass could also reduce the fossil emissions by 0.5 MtCO2/yr (6.2% of in-state industrial emissions) without making changes to the facilities. In Pennsylvania, heavy industry (cement, lime, glass, and steelmaking) emits about 9.4 MtCO2eq/yr. Most of the facilities are located near sedimentary basins, facilitating the development of CCS. In addition, the presence of low-carbon energy sources can help in the deployment of electrified processes. Also, industrial byproducts such as steel slag and fly ash can be reused in low-carbon concrete mix. As shown with these two examples, there are many strategies leading to the deep decarbonization of the economy and they need to be adapted to the local context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pisciotta","given":"Maxwell"},{"family":"Pilorgé","given":"Hélène"},{"family":"Feldmann","given":"John"},{"family":"Jacobson","given":"Rory"},{"family":"Davids","given":"Justine"},{"family":"Swett","given":"Shelvey"},{"family":"Sasso","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Wilcox","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"pisciottaCurrentStateIndustrial2022","container-title":"Progress in Energy and Combustion Science","container-title-short":"Progress in Energy and Combustion Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.pecs.2021.100982","ISSN":"0360-1285","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"page":"100982","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Current state of industrial heating and opportunities for decarbonization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360128521000800","volume":"91"},{"id":"pivovarHydrogenTargetingKg2021","abstract":"Hydrogen: Targeting $1/kg in 1 Decade, Bryan S.

Yet, scientific understanding of anthropogenic freshwater change and its long-term evolution is limited. Using a multi-model ensemble of global hydrological models, we estimate how, over a 145-year industrial period, streamflow and soil moisture have deviated from pre-industrial baseline conditions (defined by 5th–95th percentiles, at 0.5° grid level and monthly time step). We find increased frequency of local deviations on ~45% of land area, mainly in regions under heavy direct or indirect human pressures. To estimate humanity’s aggregate impact on the freshwater cycle, we present the evolution of deviation occurrence at regional to global scales. Currently, local streamflow and soil moisture deviations occur on 18.2% and 15.8% of global land area, respectively, which is 8.0 and 4.7 percentage points beyond the ~3 percentage point wide pre-industrial variability envelope.

To ease the burdens of conducting sustainability studies, especially life cycle assessments (LCA), practitioners may consider integrating large language models (LLM) into LCAs. This emerging application may offer some advantages due to the capability of these models to generate and process text quickly and efficiently, decreasing the time it takes to complete an LCA and increasing the accessibility of LCAs. In this perspective, we assess the ability of LLMs to complete LCA tasks and encourage the LCA community to study the potential strategies for enhancing the integration of LLMs in LCA methodologies and collaborate to develop standards for responsible use. Because of these advantages, LLMs show promise for life cycle inventory data collection and interpreting the life cycle impact assessment. Challenges arise primarily from the inclusion of hallucinations in the content generated by the LLM, which can be mitigated if the LCA practitioner uses prompt engineering techniques. Moreover, the risk that models cannot take responsibility for generated content can be ameliorated by having the LCA practitioner carefully review the LLM output and take responsibility for decisions made based on the generated content. So long as appropriate steps are taken to overcome the challenges and risks of using of LLMs for LCA, the opportunities presented by integrating the generative AI models can streamline the LCA process and result in significant benefits for the LCA practitioner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Preuss","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Alshehri","given":"Abdulelah S."},{"family":"You","given":"Fengqi"}],"citation-key":"preussLargeLanguageModels2024","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142824","ISSN":"0959-6526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,10]]},"page":"142824","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Large language models for life cycle assessments: Opportunities, challenges, and risks","title-short":"Large language models for life cycle assessments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262402273X","volume":"466"},{"id":"princeInductiveTeachingLearning2006","abstract":"Traditional engineering instruction is deductive, beginning with theories and progressing to the applications of those theories.

Several methods of analyses including metaheuristic optimization algorithms, artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms are being developed and used. Predictive ML models for two modified IEEE 14-bus and IEEE-30 bus systems, integrated with renewable energy sources (solar and wind) and reactive power compensative device (STATCOM) are proposed and developed with features that include hour of the day, solar irradiation, wind velocity, dynamic grid price and system load. An hour-wise input database for the model development is generated from monthly average data and hour-wise daily curves with normally distributed standard deviations. The data feasibility tests and output database generation is performed using MATLAB. Linear and higher order polynomial regression models are developed for the 8760hr database using Python 3.0 in JupyterLab and a best-fit predictive ML model is identified by analysing the coefficients of determination.

Due to the possibility of not emitting CO2 during its generation and use, hydrogen is considered a perfect substitute for current fossil fuels. However, a major drawback of hydrogen production by water electrolysis, supplied by renewable electricity, is its limited economic competitiveness compared to conventional energy sources. Therefore, this work focuses on analyzing the sustainability of a green hydrogen production plant, not only considering its environmental parameters, as well as its economic, energy and efficiency parameters. The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) is selected as the most promising method of green hydrogen production in the medium and long term. Subsequently, a small-scale production plant is simulated using chemical process simulation software to obtain key data for computing a set of sustainability indicators. The selected indicators are based on the Gauging Reaction Effectiveness for the Environmental Sustainability of Chemistries with a Multi-Objective Process Evaluator (GREENSCOPE) methodology and are used to compare the sustainability of the simulated PEM plant with alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) plant. Finally, the process is scaled-up to analyze the feasibility of the simulated PEM system and validated against data to determine the operation of the electrolyser at a large production scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rabascall","given":"Jordi Béjar"},{"family":"Mirlekar","given":"Gaurav"}],"citation-key":"rabascallSustainabilityAnalysisSimulation2023","DOI":"10.3384/ecp200015","event-title":"64th International Conference of Scandinavian Simulation Society, SIMS 2023 Västerås, Sweden, September 25-28, 2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"110-117","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sustainability analysis and simulation of a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolyser for green hydrogen production","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ecp.ep.liu.se/index.php/sims/article/view/756"},{"id":"rabouHighEfficiencyProduction2012","abstract":"The Energy research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) is developing technology for the production of Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) from biomass with 70% efficiency.

A mesophilic (37°C) 0.058m3 trickle-bed reactor with an immobilized hydrogenotrophic enrichment culture was operated for a period of 8months using a substrate mix of molecular hydrogen (H2) and biogas (36–42% CO2). Complete CO2 conversion (>96%) was achieved up to a H2 loading rate of 6.5mn3H2/m3reactor vol.×d, corresponding to 2.3h gas retention time. The optimum H2/CO2 ratio was determined to be between 3.67 and 4.15. CH4 concentrations above 96% were achieved with less than 0.1% residual H2. This gas quality complies even with tightest standards for grid injection without the need for additional CO2 removal. If less rigid standards must be fulfilled H2 loading rates can be almost doubled (10.95 versus 6.5mn3H2/m3reactor vol.×d) making the process even more attractive. At this H2 loading the achieved methane productivity was 2.52mn3CH4/m3reactor vol.×d. In terms of biogas this corresponds to an upgrading capacity of 6.9mn3biogas/m3reactor vol.×d.

This work presents a technology cost assessment and outlook towards 2030 for alkaline electrolysers (AEL) and PEM electrolysers (PEMEL) in the MW to GW range taking into consideration the effects of plant size and expected technology developments. Critical selected data was fitted to a modified power law to describe the cost of an electrolyser plant based on the overall capacity and a learning/technology development rate to derive cost estimations for different PEMEL and AEL plant capacities towards 2030. The analysis predicts that the CAPEX gap between AEL and PEMEL technologies will decrease significantly towards 2030 with plant size until 1–10 MW range. Beyond this, only marginal cost reductions can be expected with CAPEX values approaching 320–400 $/kW for large scale (greater than 100 MW) plants by 2030 with subsequent cost reductions possible. Learning rates for electrolysers were estimated at 25–30% for both AEL and PEMEL, which are significantly higher than the learning rates reported in previous literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Reksten","given":"Anita H."},{"family":"Thomassen","given":"Magnus S."},{"family":"Møller-Holst","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Sundseth","given":"Kyrre"}],"citation-key":"rekstenProjectingFutureCost2022","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.08.306","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"90","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,9]]},"note":"Read_Status: Read\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-14T15:48:05.585Z","page":"38106-38113","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Projecting the future cost of PEM and alkaline water electrolysers; a CAPEX model including electrolyser plant size and technology development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922040253","volume":"47"},{"id":"ReportArchivesPage","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,3]]},"citation-key":"ReportArchivesPage","container-title":"BloombergNEF","language":"en-US","title":"Report Archives | Page 13 of 82","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://about.bnef.com/blog/category/report/"},{"id":"Repository","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"citation-key":"Repository","title":"Repository","type":"webpage","URL":"https://peptideatlas.org/repository/"},{"id":"rezkMaximizingGreenHydrogen2023","abstract":"The use of green hydrogen as a fuel source for marine applications has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the industry. The development of a sustainable and cost-effective method for producing green hydrogen has gained a lot of attention. Water electrolysis is the best and most environmentally friendly method for producing green hydrogen-based renewable energy. Therefore, identifying the ideal operating parameters of the water electrolysis process is critical to hydrogen production. Three controlling factors must be appropriately identified to boost hydrogen generation, namely electrolysis time (min), electric voltage (V), and catalyst amount (μg). The proposed methodology contains the following two phases: modeling and optimization. Initially, a robust model of the water electrolysis process in terms of controlling factors was established using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based on the experimental dataset. After that, a modern pelican optimization algorithm (POA) was employed to identify the ideal parameters of electrolysis duration, electric voltage, and catalyst amount to enhance hydrogen production. Compared to the measured datasets and response surface methodology (RSM), the integration of ANFIS and POA improved the generated hydrogen by around 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ANFIS modeling and optimal parameter identification in optimizing the performance of solar-powered water electrocatalysis systems for green hydrogen production in marine applications. This research could pave the way for the more widespread adoption of this technology in the marine industry, which would help to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint and promote sustainability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Rezk","given":"Hegazy"},{"family":"Olabi","given":"A.

Steady-state optimization shows that individual BoP per stack (with higher CAPEX) is optimal when the plant is expected to operate at high capacity. For shared BoP and PS, the hydrogen production is higher by 8–12% when operated with variable lye flowrate compared to fixed lye flowrate.

The outcome of an analysis is largely dictated by the product’s price, as selected by the practitioner. Representative future price distributions are required as inputs to investment, sensitivity, and uncertainty analyses across the 20 to 25 year plant life. However, current price selection procedures are open to subjective judgment, not adequately considered, or neglected by calculating a minimum selling price. This work presents a machine learning methodology to produce unbiased projections of future price distributions for use in a techno-economic analysis. The method uses an ensemble of 100 neural network models with Long Short-Term Memory layers. The models are trained on the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) long-term crude oil projections and a commodity’s historic price data. The proposed method is demonstrated by projecting the price of five commodity chemicals 26 years into the future using 12 years of historic data. Alongside the economic outlook extracted from the EIA projections, the five commodity price distributions capture stochastic and deterministic elements specific to each commodity. A statistically significant difference was observed when using the price projections to revise the Net Present Value distributions for two previous techno-economic analyses. This suggests that relying on heuristics when selecting price ranges and distributions is unrepresentative of a commodity’s price uncertainty. The novelty of this work is the presentation of an unbiased machine learning approach to project long-term probabilistic prices for techno-economic analyses, emphasising the pitfalls of less rigorous approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodgers","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Bowler","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Fanran"},{"family":"Poulston","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"McKechnie","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Conradie","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"rodgersProbabilisticCommodityPrice2023","container-title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","container-title-short":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106065","ISSN":"0952-1976","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"page":"106065","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Probabilistic commodity price projections for unbiased techno-economic analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095219762300249X","volume":"122"},{"id":"rodgersSurrogateModelEconomic2024","abstract":"Supercritical water gasification is a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production from high moisture content biomass.

Increasing data availability and rapid development of machine learning (ML) approaches offer new opportunities to advance LCA. Here, we review current progress and knowledge gaps in applying ML techniques to support LCA, and identify future research directions for LCAs to better harness the power of ML. This review analyzes forty studies reporting quantitative assessment with a combination of LCA and ML methods. We found that ML approaches have been used for generating life cycle inventories, computing characterization factors, estimating life cycle impacts, and supporting life cycle interpretation. Most of the reviewed studies employed a single ML method, with artificial neural networks (ANNs) as the most frequently applied approach. Both supervised and unsupervised ML techniques were used in LCA studies. For studies using supervised ML, training datasets were derived from diverse sources, such as literature, lab experiments, existing databases, and model simulations. Over 70 % of these reviewed studies trained ML models with less than 1500 sample datasets. Although these reviewed studies showed that ML approaches help improve prediction accuracy, pattern discovery and computational efficiency, multiple areas deserve further research. First, continuous data collection and compilation is needed to support more reliable ML and LCA modeling. Second, future studies should report sufficient details regarding the selection criteria for ML models and present model uncertainty analysis. Third, incorporating deep learning models into LCA holds promise to further improve life cycle inventory and impact assessment. Finally, the complexity of current environmental challenges calls for interdisciplinary collaborative research to achieve deep integration of ML into LCA to support sustainable development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Romeiko","given":"Xiaobo Xue"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xuesong"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Yulei"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Shao"},{"family":"Babbitt","given":"Callie"}],"citation-key":"romeikoReviewMachineLearning2024","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168969","ISSN":"0048-9697","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,20]]},"page":"168969","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A review of machine learning applications in life cycle assessment studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723075988","volume":"912"},{"id":"romeoNonstoichiometricMethanationStrategy2022","abstract":"The utilization of power to gas technologies to store renewable electricity surpluses in the form of hydrogen enables the integration of the gas and electricity sectors allowing the decarbonization of the natural gas network through green hydrogen injection. Nevertheless, the injection of significant amounts of hydrogen may lead to high local concentrations that may degrade materials (e.g. hydrogen embrittlement of pipelines) and in general be not acceptable for the correct and safe operation of appliances. Most countries have specific regulations to limit hydrogen concentration in the gas network. The methanation of hydrogen represents a potential option to facilitate its injection into the grid. However, stoichiometric methanation will lead to a significant presence of carbon dioxide, limited in gas networks, and requires an accurate design of several reactors in series to achieve relevant concentrations of methane. These requirements are smoothed when the methanation is undertaken under non-stoichiometric conditions (high H/C ratio). This study aims to assess to influence of non-stoichiometric methanation under different H/C ratios on the limitations presented by the pure hydrogen injection. The impact of this injection on the operation of the gas network at local level has been investigated and the fluid-dynamics and the quality of gas blends have been evaluated.

The resulting Pd/In2O3 catalyst is In2O3 supported highly-dispersed Pd-nanoparticles exposing predominately the (111) facets with particle sizes of 3.6nm. Such Pd nanoparticles have a better ability to dissociatively adsorb hydrogen, thereby supplying hydrogen for the hydrogenation steps and facilitating oxygen vacancy creation.

However, the transformation of raw materials into their respective final goods involves the consumption of mass and energy and the possible generation of by-products and releases. To address these issues, the new approach for chemical processing is focused on sustainable production: minimize raw material consumption and energy loads, minimize/eliminate releases, and increase the economic feasibility of the process. To evaluate these advances, a sustainability assessment methodology, GREENSCOPE, has been developed into a tool to evaluate and assist in the synthesis and design of chemical processes. New process sustainability indicators have been proposed based on input/output process data, and the base-case ratio approach is implemented to predict process changes from known process performance data and design relationships. In addition, a discussion regarding the implications of using sustainability evaluations beyond the process boundaries, applying the principles of green chemistry in all steps of chemical process development, and a description of their benefits to the life cycle inventory and the subsequent life cycle assessment is included.

High proton conductivity is the most important characteristic of the PEM, as this contributes to the performance and efficiency of the fuel cell. However, it is also important to take into account the membrane’s durability to ensure that it canmaintain itsperformance under the actual fuel cell’s operating conditions and serve a long lifetime. The current state-of-the-art Nafion membranes are limited due to their high cost, loss of conductivity at elevated temperatures due to dehydration, and fuel crossover. Alternatives to Nafion have become a well-researched topic in recent years. Aromatic-based membranes where the polymer chains are linked together by aromatic rings, alongside varying numbers of ether, ketone, or sulfone functionalities, imide, or benzimidazoles in their structures, are one of the alternatives that show great potential as PEMs due totheir electrochemical, mechanical, and thermal strengths. Membranes based on these polymers, such as poly(aryl ether ketones) (PAEKs) and polyimides (PIs), however, lack a sufficient level of proton conductivity and durability to be practical for use in fuel cells. Therefore, membrane modifications are necessary to overcome their drawbacks. This paper reviews the challenges associated with different types of aromatic-based PEMs, plus the recent approaches that have been adopted to enhance their properties and performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"S.","given":"Raja Rafidah R."},{"family":"W.","given":"Rashmi"},{"family":"M.","given":"Khalid"},{"family":"Y.","given":"Wong W."},{"family":"J.","given":"Priyanka"}],"citation-key":"s.RecentProgressDevelopment2020","container-title":"Polymers","DOI":"10.3390/polym12051061","ISSN":"2073-4360","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-26T19:27:48.843Z","number":"5","page":"1061","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Recent Progress in the Development of Aromatic Polymer-Based Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/5/1061","volume":"12"},{"id":"sabatierHowHaveBeen1926","author":[{"family":"Sabatier","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"sabatierHowHaveBeen1926","container-title":"Industrial & Engineering Chemistry","container-title-short":"Industrial & Engineering Chemistry","ISSN":"0019-7866","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["1926"]]},"page":"1005-1008","publisher":"ACS Publications","title":"How I have been led to the direct hydrogenation method by metallic Catalysts1","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},{"id":"sabatierMethodDirectHydrogenation1912","author":[{"family":"Sabatier","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Lecture","given":"Nobel"}],"citation-key":"sabatierMethodDirectHydrogenation1912","container-title":"Nobel Lecture","container-title-short":"Nobel Lecture","issued":{"date-parts":[["1912"]]},"title":"The method of direct hydrogenation by catalysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},{"id":"sabatierNewMethaneSynthesis1902","author":[{"family":"Sabatier","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Senderens","given":"Jean Baptiste"}],"citation-key":"sabatierNewMethaneSynthesis1902","container-title":"CR Acad.

This study examines the technical and economic viability of scaled H2 production from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, through an in-depth techno-economic and cost-benefit analysis. The results demonstrate that the H2 yield obtained exclusively from plastic waste exceeds that from mixed-feed waste by ∼ 24.5 %. Equally significant, the LCOH stands at ∼4.96/kg-H2, inclusive of CO2 capture and storage charges, while decreasing to 4.10/kg-H2 when excluding such charges. The integration of previously overlooked key macro and micro-economic and financial parameters has facilitated a more nuanced and practical evaluation of the levelized cost of H2, allowing for a fair comparison with the current market cost of blue H2.These findings are of significance for investors and decision-makers operating within the realm of ecological sustainability and energy transition, while concurrently serving as an indispensable benchmark for the formulation of sensible waste management policies.","author":[{"family":"Sadiq","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Rajeevkumar Urs","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"El Fadel","given":"Mutasem"},{"family":"Mayyas","given":"Ahmad"}],"citation-key":"sadiqTechnoeconomicAnalysisH22023","container-title":"Energy Conversion and Management: X","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecmx.2023.100491","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"100491-100491","title":"Techno-economic analysis of H2@Scale production from organic municipal solid waste","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590174523001472","volume":"20"},{"id":"saeedmaneshHydrogenEssentialSustainability2018","author":[{"family":"Saeedmanesh","given":"Alireza"},{"family":"Kinnon","given":"Michael Mac"},{"family":"Brouwer","given":"Jack"}],"citation-key":"saeedmaneshHydrogenEssentialSustainability2018","container-title":"Current Opinion in Electrochemistry","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"title":"Hydrogen is essential for sustainability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134785339"},{"id":"sahaGreyBlueGreen2024","abstract":"Energy is the linchpin for economic development despite its generation deficit worldwide.

However, significant bottlenecks to further lowering production costs through electrolysis are hampered by technological gaps in the development of high-pressure PEM electrolysers up to 350 bar or 700 bar. While 30–40 bar PEM electrolysers have been widely commercialised, only one 700 bar PEM electrolyser is on the market.

The ejector refrigeration cycle not only uses geothermal waste heat but also facilitates the liquefaction process through precooling hydrogen; therefore, it significantly improves the overall performance of the integrated system. In addition, the modified liquefaction cycle is suggested, which is superior to common ones.

In this research, the final goal is to determine the best path for this process in order to reach a minimum level of environmental pollution and maximum yield. Based on that, machine learning approaches including artificial neural networks and Bayesian optimization-based support vector machine kernel were employed for the carbon dioxide methanation process with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst to find the first objective function, and then an environmental model was formulated based on life cycle assessment results in order to generate global warming potential. The multi-objective optimization problem, which was based on four decision parameters (temperature, pressure, hydrogen to carbon ration, and gas velocity), was computed using a genetic algorithm, and decision-making techniques were used for finding the best solution.

Energy from fossil fuels is cheaper but it faces some challenges compared to renewable energy resources. Thus, one of the most potential candidates to fulfil the energy requirements are renewable resources and the most environmentally friendly fuel is Hydrogen. Hydrogen is a clean and efficient energy carrier and a hydrogen-based economy is now widely regarded as a potential solution for the future of energy security and sustainability. Hydrogen energy became the most significant energy as the current demand gradually starts to increase. It is an important key solution to tackle the global temperature rise. The key important factor of hydrogen production is the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen production technologies are commercially available, while some of these technologies are still under development. Therefore, the global interest in minimising the effects of greenhouse gases as well as other pollutant gases also increases. In order to investigate hydrogen implementation as a fuel or energy carrier, easily obtained broad-spectrum knowledge on a variety of processes is involved as well as their advantages, disadvantages, and potential adjustments in making a process that is fit for future development. Aside from directly using the hydrogen produced from these processes in fuel cells, streams rich with hydrogen can also be utilised in producing ethanol, methanol, gasoline as well as various chemicals of high value.

It is discussed whether the gas should be compressed in subsequent gas compressors or by the electrolyzer. While gas compressor stages can be reduced in the case of electrochemical compression, safety problems arise for thin membranes due to the undesired permeation of hydrogen across the membrane to the oxygen side, forming an explosive gas. In this study, a PEM system is modeled to evaluate the membrane-specific total system efficiency. The optimum efficiency is given depending on the external heat requirement, permeation, cell pressure, current density, and membrane thickness. It shows that the heat requirement and hydrogen permeation dominate the maximum efficiency below 1.6 V, while, above, the cell polarization is decisive. In addition, a pressure-optimized cell operation is introduced by which the optimum cathode pressure is set as a function of current density and membrane thickness. This approach indicates that thin membranes do not provide increased safety issues compared to thick membranes. However, operating an N212-based system instead of an N117-based one can generate twice the amount of hydrogen at the same system efficiency while only one compressor stage must be added.","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en13030612","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"3","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"number: 3\npublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","page":"612","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Improving the Efficiency of PEM Electrolyzers through Membrane-Specific Pressure Optimization","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/3/612","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Scheepers","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Stähler","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Stähler","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Rauls","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Carmo","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Lehnert","given":"Werner"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"citation-key":"scheepersImprovingEfficiencyPEM2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"scheepersImprovingEfficiencyPEM2020"},{"id":"schmidtModelingOverpotentialsRelated2020","abstract":"Porous transport layers (PTL) are key components of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) cells controlling species transport.

To decouple the effect of the platinum loading and layer thickness from each other, the experiments were categorized in two sets, each with cathode loadings varying between 0.1 and 0.4 mgPt cm−2: (i) Samples with a constant Pt/C ratio and thus varying layer thickness, and (ii) samples with varying Pt/C ratios, achieved by dilution with bare carbon, to maintain a constant layer thickness at different platinum loadings. Every MEA was subjected to an accelerated stress test, where the cell was operated for 45,000 cycles between 0.6 and 0.95 V. Regardless of the Pt/C ratio, a higher relative loss in electrochemically active surface area was measured for lower Pt loadings. STEM-EDS measurements showed that Pt was mainly lost close to the cathode—membrane interface by the concentration driven Pt2+ ion flux into the membrane. The size of this Pt-depletion zone has shown to be independent on the overall Pt loading and layer thickness, hence causing higher relative Pt loss in low thickness electrodes, as the depletion zone accounts for a larger fraction of the catalyst layer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Batool","given":"Mariah"},{"family":"Godoy","given":"Andres O."},{"family":"Singh","given":"Rajveer"},{"family":"Gerteisen","given":"Dietmar"},{"family":"Jankovic","given":"Jasna"},{"family":"Zamel","given":"Nada"}],"citation-key":"schneiderImpactPlatinumLoading2023","container-title":"Journal of The Electrochemical Society","container-title-short":"J.

Fuel cell technology is one such renewable energy technology that is proliferating all over the world. Fuel cells will be an important future source of power and energy generation. Various advantages of fuel cells have led many researchers to work towards this technology. Different types of fuel cells are used for energy and power generation. Among all other contenders, Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) has wide acceptance worldwide due to certain innate advantages. The current study aims to know about the characteristics and primacy of the PEM fuel cells, which involves both experimental and theoretical observations based on Hydro Genius Professional - a laboratory scale model. The experiments were performed to investigate the characteristics of a fuel cell through renewable energy-driven power sources, mainly solar power. However, the last part of the article deals with a solar panel's voltage-current and power-current characteristics. Further, the optimization of parameters for extracting maximum power from the circuit is also analyzed. The research further includes the determination of Faraday and energy efficiencies for an electrolyzer and a fuel cell system, which are around 95.75% and 98%, for Faraday efficiency calculations and 90% and 45% for energy efficiency calculations in an electrolyzer and fuel cell system respectively.

However, valorizing waste organics alongside recovered water is critical for the viability of utilities, industry, and next generation biorefineries. To that end, we employ a quantitative sustainable design (QSD) methodology to set a research agenda for the development of anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) for the conversion of dilute, aqueous organic carbon into methane-rich biogas, with the simultaneous recovery of quality water. 150 unique AnMBR configurations were assembled as the landscape of possible development pathways. Each configuration was evaluated by integrating full-scale design and operation with techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) in a Monte Carlo framework. Costs and environmental impacts were most sensitive to membrane configuration, membrane type, and inclusion of granular activated carbon (GAC) as physical media for membrane scouring. The least expensive designs (20th percentile) were exclusively AnMBRs with cross-flow, multi-tube membranes. Research targets were set through sensitivity analyses, prioritizing a decrease in cross-flow velocity (<0.5 m s−1), elimination of gas sparging, increase in membrane life (>10 years), decrease in upflow velocity for physical media bed expansion (<7.5 m h−1), and the development of low-cost physical media for fouling mitigation. Lastly, a subset of AnMBR designs had costs below state-of-the-art treatment (high rate activated sludge with anaerobic digestion), demonstrating the valorization of waste organics would be financially advantageous to industry and utilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Shoener","given":"Brian D."},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Greiner","given":"Anthony D."},{"family":"Khunjar","given":"Wendell O."},{"family":"Hong","given":"Pei-Ying"},{"family":"Guest","given":"Jeremy S."}],"citation-key":"shoenerDesignAnaerobicMembrane2016","container-title":"Energy & Environmental Science","container-title-short":"Energy Environ.

A very small loss of efficiency, corresponding to 30mV voltage increase, was recorded at 3A⋅cm−2 using a total noble metal catalyst loading of less than 0.5mg·cm−2 (compared to the industry standard of 2mg·cm−2). Steady-state durability tests, carried out for 1000h at 1A⋅cm−2, showed excellent stability for the MEA with total noble metal catalyst loading of 1.6mg·cm−2 (cell voltage increase ∼5μV/h). Moderate degradation rate (cell voltage increase ∼15μV/h) was recorded for the low loading 0.5mg·cm−2, MEA. Similar stability characteristics were observed in durability tests at 3A·cm−2.

Hydrogen is viewed as a potential enabler of deep decarbonization, notably in hard-to-abate sectors such as the industry. A multi-modal, hourly resolved, linear programming model was developed to assess the infrastructure requirements of a low-carbon supply chain over a large region. It optimizes the deployment of infrastructure from 2025 up to 2050 by assessing four years: 2025, 2030, 2040, and 2050, and is location agnostic. The considered infrastructure encompasses several technologies for production, transmission, and storage. Model results illustrate supply chain requirements in Texas and Louisiana. Edge cases considering 100% electrolytic production were analyzed. Results show that by 2050, with an assumed industrial demand of 276 TWh/year, Texas and Louisiana would require 62 GW of electrolyzers, 102 GW of onshore wind, and 32 GW of solar panels. The resulting levelized cost of hydrogen totaled $5.6–6.3/kgH2 in 2025, decreasing to $3.2–3.5/kgH2 in 2050. Most of the electricity production occurs in Northwest Texas thanks to high capacity factors for both renewable technologies. Hydrogen is produced locally and transmitted through pipelines to demand centers around the Gulf Coast, instead of electricity being transmitted for electrolytic production co-located with demand. Large-scale hydrogen storage is highly beneficial in the system to provide buffer between varying electrolytic hydrogen production and constant industrial demand requirements. In a system without low-cost storage, liquid and compressed tanks are deployed, and there is a significant renewable capacity overbuild to ensure greater electrolyzer capacity factors, resulting in higher electricity curtailment. A system under carbon constraint sees the deployment of natural gas-derived hydrogen production. Lax carbon constraint target result in an important reliance on this production method due to its low cost, while stricter targets enforce a great share of electrolytic production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Sizaire","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Bosong"},{"family":"Gençer","given":"Emre"}],"citation-key":"sizaireNovelHydrogenSupply2024","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.06.236","ISSN":"0360-3199","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,12]]},"page":"401-420","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A novel hydrogen supply chain optimization model – Case study of Texas and Louisiana","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319924024728","volume":"78"},{"id":"sofiaCostbenefitAnalysisSupport2020","abstract":"Mitigation strategies towards progressive decarbonization of the energy system are a valid approach to slow environmental pollution yielding social benefits, as established from National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP).

This study proposes a generic dynamical model of the PEM electrolysis system represented in a modular fashion using Bond Graph (BG) as a unified modelling approach. Causal and functional properties of the BG facilitate the formal PEM electrolyser model to adapt and to fit the different configurations of the electrolyser ranging from laboratory scale to industrial scale. The system-specific key parameter values are identified optimally for a laboratory-scale electrolyser system running on a multi-source energy platform using experimental data. The mean absolute percentage error between simulation and experimental data is found to be less than 5%. The performance characteristic curves of the electrolyser are predicted at different operating temperatures using the identified key parameters. The predicted performance is in good agreement with the expected behaviour of the electrolyser found in the literature. The model also estimates the different energy losses and the real-time efficiency of the system under dynamic inputs. With these capabilities, the developed model provides an economical mean for design, control, and diagnosis development of such systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sood","given":"Sumit"},{"family":"Prakash","given":"Om"},{"family":"Boukerdja","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Dieulot","given":"Jean-Yves"},{"family":"Ould-Bouamama","given":"Belkacem"},{"family":"Bressel","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Gehin","given":"Anne-Lise"}],"citation-key":"soodGenericDynamicalModel2020","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en13246556","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"24","page":"6556","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Generic Dynamical Model of PEM Electrolyser under Intermittent Sources","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/24/6556","volume":"13"},{"id":"sparkedadminPathHydrogenCompetitiveness2020","abstract":"This latest Hydrogen Council report shows that the cost of hydrogen solutions will fall sharply within the next decade – and sooner than previously expected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"sparkedadmin","given":""}],"citation-key":"sparkedadminPathHydrogenCompetitiveness2020","container-title":"Hydrogen Council","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,20]]},"language":"en-CA","title":"Path to Hydrogen Competitiveness: A Cost Perspective","title-short":"Path to Hydrogen Competitiveness","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://hydrogencouncil.com/en/path-to-hydrogen-competitiveness-a-cost-perspective/"},{"id":"srettiwatTechnoeconomicEvaluationSolarpowered2023","abstract":"This study focuses on the production and consumption of solar-powered green hydrogen in Belgium by comparing the costs of domestic production with those of imports from Morocco and Namibia.

One of the ways to produce hydrogen is high-temperature water-steam electrolysis. Increasing the temperature of the steam involved in electrolysis makes the process more efficient. The key problem is the use of a reliable heat energy source capable of reaching high temperatures. High-temperature gas-cooled reactors with a gaseous coolant and a graphite moderator provide a solution to the problem of heating the electrolyte. Part of the heat energy is used for producing electrical energy required for electrolysis. Modern electrolyzers built as arrays of tubular or planar electrolytic cells with a nuclear energy source make it possible to produce hydrogen by decomposing water molecules, and the working temperature control leads to a decrease in the Nernst potential. The operation of such facilities is complicated by the need to determine the optimal parameters of the electrolysis cell, the steam flow rate, and the operating current density. To reduce the costs associated with the process optimization, it is proposed to use a low-temperature electrolysis system controlled by a spiking neural network. The results confirm the effectiveness of intelligent technologies that implement adaptive control of hybrid modeling processes in order to organize the most feasible hydrogen production in a specific process, the parameters of which can be modified depending on the specific use of the reactor thermal energy. In addition, the results of the study confirm the feasibility of using a combined functional structure made on the basis of spiking neurons to correct the parameters of the developed electrolytic system.

The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS\n              PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development.\n              \n                \n                  Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries.\n                  \n                    The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO\n                    2\n                    concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.\n                  \n                \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Steffen","given":"Will"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Cornell","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Fetzer","given":"Ingo"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Elena M."},{"family":"Biggs","given":"Reinette"},{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"De Vries","given":"Wim"},{"family":"De Wit","given":"Cynthia A."},{"family":"Folke","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Gerten","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"Heinke","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Mace","given":"Georgina M."},{"family":"Persson","given":"Linn M."},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Veerabhadran"},{"family":"Reyers","given":"Belinda"},{"family":"Sörlin","given":"Sverker"}],"citation-key":"steffenPlanetaryBoundariesGuiding2015","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1259855","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6223","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,13]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.sciencemag.org/about/science-licenses-journal-article-reuse","page":"1259855","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing planet","title-short":"Planetary boundaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1259855","volume":"347"},{"id":"steninaModernTechnologiesHydrogen2023","abstract":"Transitioning to energy-saving and renewable energy sources is impossible without accelerated development of hydrogen energy and hydrogen technologies.

When polymer electrolyte electrolyzers are operated at elevated pressures, to reduce external mechanical compression needs, the thermodynamically expected cell voltage increase with pressure is not generally observed. Consequently, beneficial processes have to compensate for the increased work performed. In this paper, the influence of the operating pressure up to 100bar on the cell voltage behavior is investigated in detail. Data from galvanotstatic polarization curves up to 4A/cm2 combined with high frequency resistance measurements are analyzed using a zero-dimensional Tafel model. It shows that beneficial processes with increasing pressure are related to both the kinetic and mass transport overpotentials. At current densities above 1A/cm2 about two thirds of the overpotential gain can be related to reaction kinetics. Based on the Tafel model approach an increase of the apparent exchange current density by a factor of 4 to 7 is observed for the pressure increase from 10 to 100 bar. In contrast, the Tafel slope is independent of pressure and only the expected increase with temperature (73 to 81mV/dec) for 30 to 70°C is observed. Mass transport losses decrease with pressure. At 50°C and 2A/cm2, increasing the pressure from 1 to 100bar results in a decrease of the mass transport overpotential from 130 to 80mV.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Suermann","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Büchi","given":"Felix N."}],"citation-key":"suermannCellPerformanceDetermining2016","container-title":"Electrochimica Acta","container-title-short":"Electrochimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.120","ISSN":"0013-4686","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,1]]},"page":"989-997","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Cell Performance Determining Parameters in High Pressure Water Electrolysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468616314372","volume":"211"},{"id":"suermannFemtosecondLaserinducedSurface2020","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Suermann","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Gimpel","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"V. Bühre","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Schade","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Bensmann","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Hanke-Rauschenbach","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"suermannFemtosecondLaserinducedSurface2020","container-title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry A","DOI":"10.1039/C9TA12127G","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"4898-4910","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","source":"pubs.rsc.org","title":"Femtosecond laser-induced surface structuring of the porous transport layers in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/ta/c9ta12127g","volume":"8"},{"id":"sultanaBiohydrogenFoodWaste2023","abstract":"This study demonstrated the application of a hybrid Bayesian algorithm (BA) and support vector regression (SVR) as a potential super-learner tool (BA-SVR) to predict biohydrogen production from food waste-originated feedstocks.

Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes like Nafion® and Aquivion® are the state-of-the-art PEMs, but there is a need to increase the operating temperature to improve mass transport, avoid catalyst poisoning and electrode flooding, increase efficiency, and reduce the cost and complexity of the system. However, PSFAs-based membranes exhibit lower mechanical and chemical stability, as well as proton conductivity at lower relative humidities and temperatures above 80 °C. One approach to sustain performance is to introduce inorganic fillers and improve water retention due to their hydrophilicity. Alternatively, polymers where protons are not conducted as hydrated H3O+ ions through liquid-like water channels as in the PSFAs, but as free protons (H+) via Brønsted acid sites on the polymer backbone, can be developed. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) and sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SPEEK) are such materials, but need considerable acid doping. Different composites are being investigated to solve some of the accompanying problems and reach sufficient conductivities. Herein, we critically discuss a few representative investigations of composite PEMs and evaluate their significance. Moreover, we present advances in introducing electronic conductivity in the polymer binder in the catalyst layers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Xinwei"},{"family":"Simonsen","given":"Stian Christopher"},{"family":"Norby","given":"Truls"},{"family":"Chatzitakis","given":"Athanasios"}],"citation-key":"sunCompositeMembranesHigh2019","container-title":"Membranes","DOI":"10.3390/membranes9070083","ISSN":"2077-0375","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"Read_Status: New\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-06-10T16:55:48.783Z","number":"7","page":"83","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Composite Membranes for High Temperature PEM Fuel Cells and Electrolysers: A Critical Review","title-short":"Composite Membranes for High Temperature PEM Fuel Cells and Electrolysers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/9/7/83","volume":"9"},{"id":"tadaNiCeO2Catalysts2012","abstract":"CO2 methanation was performed over 10 wt%Ni/CeO2, 10 wt%Ni/α-Al2O3, 10 wt%Ni/TiO2, and 10 wt%Ni/MgO, and the effect of support materials on CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity was examined.

One of the Achilles heels because of its cost is the cell membrane. Exposure of the polymeric membrane to the highly oxidative and acidic environment of the vanadium electrolyte can result in membrane deterioration. Furthermore, poor membrane selectivity towards vanadium permeability can lead to faster discharge times of the battery. These areas seek room for improvement to increase battery lifetime. The high costs of the currently used membranes substantially contribute to the price of the vanadium redox flow battery systems. Therefore, the reduction of the cost of the membrane by using alternative materials can reduce the overall battery costs substantially, thereby increasing the prospects of the industrial use of these systems. In this report different membrane types are reviewed and the important factors determining membrane performance are analysed.

Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) has attracted attention due to its ability to produce high-purity, compressed hydrogen at relatively mild operating temperatures (70°C-90°C). The highest cost contributor of the PEMWE stack are the bipolar plates (BPPs). Owing to the severe operating conditions (acidity from the membrane and high localized oxygen concentration) of the PEMWE stack, appropriate material and fabrication are crucial to ensure high performance and durability. The role of BPPs in mass transport and electrical charge transfer must be further understood and correlated to its specific application in PEMWE. At the most basic level, BPPs must have low interfacial contact resistance and high corrosion resistance to withstand the conditions within the stack. The most common base materials for BPP construction include austenitic stainless steel (SS316 and SS403) and Ti due to their flexural strength and ease of mass production. A coating layer is also necessary to protect the substrate from corrosion, and the most popular materials include TiN and other noble metals with nonpassivated oxides and reliable electrical conductivity. The compromise between material robustness and cost is currently a delicate balance toachieve.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Teuku","given":"Husaini"},{"family":"Alshami","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Goh","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Masdar","given":"Mohd Shahbudin"},{"family":"Loh","given":"Kee Shyuan"}],"citation-key":"teukuReviewBipolarPlates2021","container-title":"International Journal of Energy Research","DOI":"10.1002/er.7182","ISSN":"1099-114X","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","page":"20583-20600","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Review on bipolar plates for low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/er.7182","volume":"45"},{"id":"thompsonDeepLearningsDiminishing2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Neil C."},{"family":"Greenewald","given":"Kristjan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Keeheon"},{"family":"Manso","given":"Gabriel F."}],"citation-key":"thompsonDeepLearningsDiminishing2021","container-title":"IEEE Spectrum","container-title-short":"IEEE Spectr.","DOI":"10.1109/MSPEC.2021.9563954","ISSN":"0018-9235, 1939-9340","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"license":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html","page":"50-55","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Deep Learning's Diminishing Returns: The Cost of Improvement is Becoming Unsustainable","title-short":"Deep Learning's Diminishing Returns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9563954/","volume":"58"},{"id":"tijaniInvestigationEffectCharge2018","abstract":"Activation overpotential is a very important parameter in evaluating the performance of PEM electrolyzer, it is one of the major overpotentials that contribute towards overall operating voltage of the electrolyzer.

The increasing amount of renewable energy produced requires the development of versatile technologies capable to store the excess renewable electricity produced. Hydrogen production through electrolysis, despite not being still economically viable, can be considered a mature technology. Different strategies to convert H2 into more volumetric dense fuel are under development through Power-to-Chemicals (PtC) process. Among these, CO2 methanation offers the advantage of a wide infrastructure available for the distribution and use of methane as chemical and fuel for both heat and power generation. The latter approach is also called Power-to-Gas (PtG) process. These technologies in the last year have been the focus of research, both public and private. In particular, direct methanation of biogas obtained from anaerobic digestors represents a challenge and an interesting opportunity due to the possibility to avoid the CO2 separation step at the moment needed for biogas purification to biomethane. Since CO2 separation is an additional cost, this route can be the key for economic sustainability of the process. In this review we focus on the main aspects involved in the design of a methanation plant, with a particular focus on the biogas methanation, starting from the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics. Afterwards, light is shed on the most interesting catalysts reported in the literature, with a focus on Ni-based catalysts and considering the support role in the reaction. Different kinetic approaches currently available and promising reactor types, including different simulation models, which are becoming increasingly fundamental in the reactor design and scale-up phase, are reported. Finally, the last chapter contains the most interesting and industrially relevant ongoing projects on direct biogas methanation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Tommasi","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Degerli","given":"Simge Naz"},{"family":"Ramis","given":"Gianguido"},{"family":"Rossetti","given":"Ilenia"}],"citation-key":"tommasiAdvancementsCO2Methanation2024","container-title":"Chemical Engineering Research and Design","container-title-short":"Chemical Engineering Research and Design","DOI":"10.1016/j.cherd.2023.11.060","ISSN":"0263-8762","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"457-482","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Advancements in CO2 methanation: A comprehensive review of catalysis, reactor design and process optimization","title-short":"Advancements in CO2 methanation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263876223007700","volume":"201"},{"id":"torkyGH2_MobileNetDeepLearning2023","abstract":"Green hydrogen production is fast becoming a key technology in changing the traditional rules of energy production by relying on green energy sources. Due to the high cost of producing green hydrogen based on thermochemical, electrolytic, photolytic, and biological processes renewables, organic waste mixtures can be a good alternative and cost-effective solution for green hydrogen production. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces a proposed deep-learning approach called GH2_MobileNet for predicting the quantity of green hydrogen production (in kilograms) from an organic waste mixture dataset in images. A proposed hybrid model called MobileNet-CNN has been utilized for recognizing and classifying organic waste mixtures types, then, two methodologies called DOWE (Dry organic waste’s weight estimation), and WOWE (Wet organic waste’s weight estimation) are proposed for estimating the weight value of dry and wet organic waste images respectively. Finally, a novel algorithm called GH2PE (Green Hydrogen Production Estimation) is proposed for estimating green hydrogen quantity production (in kilograms) from both of the two types of organic waste mixtures. The proposed approach has been validated on a benchmark dataset of organic waste mixtures images. The validation results clarified that the classification accuracy and average precision, recall, and F1-score reached 98%. Moreover, the verification results of implementing DOWE and WOWE methods showed that the total estimated weight value of a set of four items of dry organic waste mixtures is 601.92 kg, whereas, the total estimated weight value of other set of four items of wet organic waste mixtures is 3627.77 kg. Finally, the prediction results of green hydrogen production from organic waste mixtures clarified that the total organic waste mixture in the used dataset produces 299.17 kg (27.09 kg from dry-waste mixtures and 272.08 kg from wet-waste mixtures) of green hydrogen. The comparison results also confirmed the outperforming of the proposed deep learning model in recognizing and classifying organic waste items compared to other deep learning models in the literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Torky","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Dahy","given":"Ghada"},{"family":"Hassanein","given":"Aboul Ella"}],"citation-key":"torkyGH2_MobileNetDeepLearning2023","container-title":"Applied Soft Computing","container-title-short":"Applied Soft Computing","DOI":"10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110215","ISSN":"1568-4946","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"page":"110215","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"GH2_MobileNet: Deep learning approach for predicting green hydrogen production from organic waste mixtures","title-short":"GH2_MobileNet","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494623002338","volume":"138"},{"id":"TotalEnergyMonthly","abstract":"Energy Information Administration - EIA - Official Energy Statistics from the U.S. Government","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,10]]},"citation-key":"TotalEnergyMonthly","title":"Total Energy Monthly Data - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/index.php"},{"id":"TragedyCommons2022","citation-key":"TragedyCommons2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Tragedy of the Commons","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"trinkeExperimentalEvidenceIncreasing2017","abstract":"Oxygen permeation in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers is a critical phenomenon. Mainly, because of (i) degradation and (ii) purity of the hydrogen product gas. Additionally, but less important because of (iii) efficiency loss and (iv) safety problems. Despite these issues, oxygen permeation in PEM water electrolysis was paid less attention. This can be explained by the low oxygen crossover compared to the hydrogen crossover. In this contribution the oxygen content within the hydrogen product gas was measured for two different cathodic catalyst materials (Pt and a Pt-free catalyst) during water electrolysis in a current density range of 0.05–2 A/cm2. In comparison to the platinum catalyst, the Pt-free catalyst leads to 3–4 times higher oxygen contents within the hydrogen product gas. This can be explained with a lower activity concerning oxygen recombination, so that less permeated oxygen is consumed and consequently, the oxygen flux within hydrogen is higher. The results of this work emphasize that the oxygen crossover increases with increasing current density, as like the hydrogen crossover does. Particularly, two effects are possible for this strong increase in oxygen permeation: supersaturation and the electro-osmotic drag. The experimental findings show that the crossover is higher as generally expected, and should receive more attention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Trinke","given":"P."},{"family":"Bensmann","given":"B."},{"family":"Hanke-Rauschenbach","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"trinkeExperimentalEvidenceIncreasing2017","container-title":"Electrochemistry Communications","container-title-short":"Electrochemistry Communications","DOI":"10.1016/j.elecom.2017.07.018","ISSN":"1388-2481","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"page":"98-102","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Experimental evidence of increasing oxygen crossover with increasing current density during PEM water electrolysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388248117302023","volume":"82"},{"id":"tugirumubanoNumericalSimulationPolymer2016","abstract":"In the development of renewable energy, polymer electrolyte membrane(PEM) electrolyzer has shown an impressive impact on the production of pure hydrogen gas, that can be used as fuel and energy storage, and oxygen gas.

In order to successfully reverse this trend, many schemes for CO2 mitigation have been proposed, taking into consideration that large-scale decarbonization is still infeasible. At the same time, the projected increase in the share of variable renewables in the future energy mix will necessitate large-scale curtailment of excess energy. Collectively, the above crucial problems can be addressed by the general scheme of CO2 hydrogenation. This refers to the conversion of both captured CO2 and green H2 produced by RES-powered water electrolysis for the production of added-value chemicals and fuels, which are a great alternative to CO2 sequestration and the use of green H2 as a standalone fuel. Indeed, direct utilization of both CO2 and H2 via CO2 hydrogenation offers, on the one hand, the advantage of CO2 valorization instead of its permanent storage, and the direct transformation of otherwise curtailed excess electricity to stable and reliable carriers such as methane and methanol on the other, thereby bypassing the inherent complexities associated with the transformation towards a H2-based economy. In light of the above, herein an overview of the two main CO2 abatement schemes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), is firstly presented, focusing on the route of CO2 hydrogenation by green electrolytic hydrogen. Next, the integration of large-scale RES-based H2 production with CO2 capture units on-site industrial point sources for the production of added-value chemicals and energy carriers is contextualized and highlighted. In this regard, a specific reference is made to the so-called Power-to-X schemes, exemplified by the production of synthetic natural gas via the Power-to-Gas route.

Besides calculating basic bibliometric indicators, we used clustering techniques and a co-occurrence analysis of author keywords to discover and characterize dominant themes in the literature.

In particular, underground hydrogen storage via the dissolution of hydrogen gas in an aqueous solution has been identified as a promising strategy to address the difficulties associated with large-scale energy storage. However, this process requires the accurate prediction of the solubility of hydrogen in aqueous solutions, which is affected by a range of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of solutes. The present study thus aimed to effectively predict the solubility of hydrogen in aqueous solutions that vary in their salinity by employing a machine learning approach. Four machine learning models were developed and tested: adaptive gradient boosting (Adaboost), gradient boosting, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. The performance of each model was quantified in terms of their coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The Adaboost algorithm exhibited superior performance across all metrics, with an R2 of 0.994, MAE of 0.006, and RMSE of 0.018. A Williams plot detected only 18 outliers in the Adaboost predictions from a total of 255 data points. These results indicate that machine learning techniques have the potential to serve as a valuable tool in the prediction of hydrogen solubility in aqueous solutions for underground hydrogen storage, facilitating the development of smart, cost-effective, and safe hydrogen storage technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vo Thanh","given":"Hung"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hemeng"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Zhenxue"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Tangparitkul","given":"Suparit"},{"family":"Min","given":"Baehyun"}],"citation-key":"vothanhDatadrivenMachineLearning2024","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.131","ISSN":"0360-3199","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"page":"1422-1433","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Data-driven machine learning models for the prediction of hydrogen solubility in aqueous systems of varying salinity: Implications for underground hydrogen storage","title-short":"Data-driven machine learning models for the prediction of hydrogen solubility in aqueous systems of varying salinity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319923064315","volume":"55"},{"id":"wangHydrogenProductionWater2021","abstract":"As a promising substitute for fossil fuels, hydrogen has emerged as a clean and renewable energy. A key challenge is the efficient production of hydrogen to meet the commercial-scale demand of hydrogen. Water splitting electrolysis is a promising pathway to achieve the efficient hydrogen production in terms of energy conversion and storage in which catalysis or electrocatalysis plays a critical role. The development of active, stable, and low-cost catalysts or electrocatalysts is an essential prerequisite for achieving the desired electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting for practical use, which constitutes the central focus of this review. It will start with an introduction of the water splitting performance evaluation of various electrocatalysts in terms of activity, stability, and efficiency. This will be followed by outlining current knowledge on the two half-cell reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in terms of reaction mechanisms in alkaline and acidic media. Recent advances in the design and preparation of nanostructured noble-metal and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts will be discussed. New strategies and insights in exploring the synergistic structure, morphology, composition, and active sites of the nanostructured electrocatalysts for increasing the electrocatalytic activity and stability in HER and OER will be highlighted.

Both systems work at low temperatures (e.g. ∼60–80 °C) and can operate free of CO2 emissions. The PEMFC efficiency can reach as high as 65% with water as the only byproduct when using hydrogen as the fuel. PEMFCs have been considered for stationary, transportation, and portable applications. Several PEMFC products are commercially available, including back-up power and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). As of May 2021, over 10 000 FCEVs were sold or leased in the U.S. and 48 fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs) currently operate in California. More than 3520 FCEVs and 22 FCEBs were sold or leased in Japan up to 2020 and China has more than 6000 FCEVs. The cost and the lack of a hydrogen infrastructure are the two main barriers to the worldwide deployment of PEMFCs. Currently, a PEMFC stack costs about $75 per kW at high volume production and its CLs account for over 40% of the overall cost due to the employment of precious platinum-group metals (PGMs) as catalysts. For FCEVs to be competitive cost-wise, the ultimate goal is $30 per kW for light-duty FCEVs and $60 per kW for heavy-duty FCEVs. Another challenge that prevents FCEVs from widespread application is that only a few hundred hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) are available in the world. To help overcome this challenge, Japan has set a target of building 320 stations by 2025 and 900 by 2030. Europe has a roadmap of achieving 1500 stations by 2025. China has over 40 HRSs and has been reported to have invested $17 billion dollars in hydrogen infrastructure. PEMECs operate in the reverse process of PEMFCs, i.e. hydrogen production through water splitting using electrical energy, and provide a promising source of renewable hydrogen to supply the fueling infrastructure. They have been successfully commercialized with power varying from a few kW to multiple MW and efficiency around 60–80%. As of 2019, over 14 MW of PEMECs have been installed or are underway across the U.S. The cost of producing hydrogen via PEMECs, which is currently at about $4–6 per kg, has been a limiting factor that prevents large-scale deployment and application. The U.S. DOE has recently set a target to achieve $1 per kg within one decade through the Hydrogen Shot initiative. The objectives of this review are three-fold: (1) to present the current status of PEMFC and PEMEC technologies and their ongoing development, along with the hydrogen infrastructure, (2) to describe the similarities and differences in PEMFC and PEMEC structures, materials, and fundamentals, and (3) to outline the major challenges and opportunities in the widespread deployment of PEMFCs and PEMECs and hydrogen infrastructure development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Yiheng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ken S."}],"citation-key":"wangPEMFuelCell2022","container-title":"Energy & Environmental Science","container-title-short":"Energy Environ.

The Pt atom in the ensemble is 100–1000 times more active than their single-atom Pt1/CeO2 parent in catalyzing the low-temperature CO oxidation under oxygen-rich conditions. Rather than the Pt-O-Ce interfacial catalysis, the stable catalytic unit is the Pt-O-Pt site itself without participation of oxygen from the 10–30 nm-size ceria support. Similar Pt-O-Pt sites can be built on various ceria and even alumina, distinguishable by facile activation of oxygen through the paired Pt-O-Pt atoms.

Further, the oxygen transmission rate of the 4%MXene-Cu2O/SPEEK was 33.67 cc m−2 day−1, whereas that of the commercially available Nafion 212 was 28.53 cc m−2 day−1.

The resulting environmental and human health impacts of such production levels are further put into context with the Planetary Boundaries framework, known human health burdens, the impacts of the world economy, and the externality-priced production costs that embody the environmental impact. The results indicate that climate change impacts of projected production levels are 3.3–5.4 times higher than the allocated planetary boundary, with only green hydrogen from wind energy staying below the boundary. Human health impacts and other environmental impacts are less severe in comparison but metal depletion and ecotoxicity impacts of green hydrogen deserve further attention.

Detailed process simulations turned out to be important to obtain a solid process design so that a realistic cost estimate is possible. This is necessary since the stated costs in literature vary by a factor of 10 due to the shortage of simulation details. In addition, cost data for the methanation from recent literature are often under-estimated due to the lack of a required second upgrading step (post-upgrading) to reach the demanded gas grid specifications and of additional process equipment. A fixed bed methanation reactor is two times more expensive than a bubbling fluidised bed reactor but due to the dominant share of costs of the electrolysis, costs differences between the whole processes of 5% are less pronounced. It turned out that a gas separation membrane and a second fixed bed, as a post-upgrading step, are equally expensive. However, a gas separation membrane seems to be technically more robust. Biomethane production costs of 10.2 Ct€/kWhtotal for processes containing a fluidised bed and of 10.7 Ct€/kWhtotal for processes containing a main fixed bed are obtained. As a consequence, the corresponding processes are profitable until an electricity price of 6.0 Ct€/kWhel and 5.3 Ct€/kWhel without considering the extra revenues from process heat and oxygen. Furthermore, the profitability of the processes increases with the methane content in the biogas. Considering extra revenues and a concentration increase of 10% for methane in the biogas, the maximum electricity price for a profitable process increases by 3 Ct€/kWhel.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Witte","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Kunz","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Biollaz","given":"Serge M.

When the Ni metal is partially covered with Na2O species, a highly positive charge on the Ni metal could occur compared to the original Ni/SiO2 catalyst. The addition of Na to the Ni/SiO2 catalyst could influence selectivity toward CO formation. The adsorbed formic acid is the major intermediate on the Ni/SiO2 catalyst during CO2 hydrogenation. The formic acid species might decompose into adsorbed CO complexes in the forms of linear CO, bridged CO and multibonded CO. CH4 formation should be ascribed to the hydrogenation of these adsorbed CO complexes. The Ni/SiO2 catalyst with the Na additive might have very weak ability for H2 and CO adsorption, thus making it difficult for CO methanation to occur.

Firstly, the original voltage data is decomposed into the calendar aging part and the reversible aging part based on locally weighted regression (LOESS). Then, we apply an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict those two components, respectively. Three-dimensional aging factors are introduced in the physical aging model to capture the overall aging trend better. We utilize the automatic machine-learning method based on the genetic algorithm to train the LSTM model more efficiently and improve prediction accuracy. The aging voltage is derived from the sum of the two predicted voltage components, and we can further realize the remaining useful life estimation.

However, various values (e.g. 100 μm, 50 μm, 10 μm) of CL thickness are reported in the previous studies. To identify the optimal CL thickness to reduce the PEMFC cost without sacrificing the electrochemical performance, it is necessary to first identify the effective reaction thickness (ERT) of both anode and cathode. A numerical non-isothermal 3D model was developed considering the activation loss, concentration loss and ohmic loss at two electrodes, respectively. After model validation, parametric analyses were performed to investigate the effects of temperature, working voltage and flow rate on the performance of the fuel cell, especially on ERT. It is found that the ERT increases with increasing temperature. The working voltage and the cathode flow rate have opposite influences on the ERT of the two electrodes. The ERT highly depends on the ratio of activation loss and concentration loss (ηact+ηconc) to ohmic loss ηohmic. Considering the utilization rate of the catalyst and cell performance, the appropriate CL thicknesses for anode and cathode electrode are 10–17 μm and 15–30 μm, respectively.

These improvements were obtained probably due to its higher surface area than TiO2 catalyst, more surface hydroxyls, and better dispersion on the ATP matrix.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Zairong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qinghe"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Lixing"},{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Jing"}],"citation-key":"yanSurfaceHydroxylsMediated2021","container-title":"Journal of CO2 Utilization","container-title-short":"Journal of CO2 Utilization","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcou.2021.101489","ISSN":"2212-9820","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"page":"101489","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Surface hydroxyls mediated CO2 methanation at ambient pressure over attapulgite-loaded Ni-TiO2 composite catalysts with high activity and reuse ability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212982021000561","volume":"47"},{"id":"yaoMachineLearningSustainable2023","abstract":"Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is a critical global challenge; it demands advances — at the materials, devices and systems levels — for the efficient harvesting, storage, conversion and management of renewable energy.

To date, great efforts have been made to investigate both the reaction mechanism and catalysts development for methanation. Here in this review, up to date references have been cited, which are aimed at giving researchers a comprehensive overview of CO2 methanation with respect to the recent advancements in reaction mechanism, catalytic materials, and the novel combination of metal active phase and its synergy. Both thermochemical and electrochemical routes of CO2 methanation have been discussed, mainly focusing on thermochemical routes.

For the economical transportation of natural gas to distant markets, physical (i.e., liquefaction and compression) or chemical (i.e., direct and indirect) monetisation options must be considered to reduce volume and meet the demand of different markets. Planning natural gas supply chains is a complex problem in today’s turbulent markets, especially considering the uncertainties associated with final market demand and competition with emerging renewable and hydrogen energies. This review study evaluates the latest research on mathematical programming (i.e., MILP and MINLP) as a decision-making tool for designing and planning natural gas supply chains under different planning horizons. The first part of this study assesses the status of existing natural gas infrastructures by addressing readily available natural monetisation options, quantitative tools for selecting monetisation options, and single-state and multistate natural gas supply chain optimisation models. The second part investigates hydrogen as a potential energy carrier for integration with natural gas supply chains, carbon capture utilisation, and storage technologies. This integration is foreseen to decarbonise systems, diversify the product portfolio, and fill the gap between current supply chains and the future market need of cleaner energy commodities. Since natural gas markets are turbulent and hydrogen energy has the potential to replace fossil fuels in the future, addressing stochastic conditions and demand uncertainty is vital to hedge against risks through designing a responsive supply chain in the project’s early design stages. Hence, hydrogen supply chain optimisation studies and the latest works on hydrogen–natural gas supply chain optimisation were reviewed under deterministic and stochastic conditions. Only quantitative mathematical models for supply chain optimisation, including linear and nonlinear programming models, were considered in this study to evaluate the effectiveness of each proposed approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Yusuf","given":"Noor"},{"family":"Al-Ansari","given":"Tareq"}],"citation-key":"yusufCurrentFutureRole2023","container-title":"Energies","container-title-short":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en16227672","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"language":"en","page":"7672","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Current and Future Role of Natural Gas Supply Chains in the Transition to a Low-Carbon Hydrogen Economy: A Comprehensive Review on Integrated Natural Gas Supply Chain Optimisation Models","title-short":"Current and Future Role of Natural Gas Supply Chains in the Transition to a Low-Carbon Hydrogen Economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/22/7672","volume":"16"},{"id":"zaccaraRenewableHydrogenProduction2020","abstract":"Within integrated steelmaking industries significant research efforts are devoted to the efficient use of resources and the reduction of CO2 emissions.

These off-gases can be further valorized as feedstock for methane and methanol syntheses, but their hydrogen content is often inadequate to reach high conversions in synthesis processes. The addition of hydrogen is fundamental and a suitable hydrogen production process must be selected to obtain advantages in process economy and sustainability. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different hydrogen production processes from renewable energy, namely polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis, solid oxide electrolyze cell electrolysis, and biomass gasification. Aspen Plus® V11-based models were developed, and simulations were conducted for sensitivity analyses to acquire useful information related to the process behavior. Advantages and disadvantages for each considered process were highlighted. In addition, the integration of the analyzed hydrogen production methods with methane and methanol syntheses is analyzed through further Aspen Plus®-based simulations.

However, its commercial realisation faces significant hurdles, including slow infrastructure growth and the high cost of producing clean hydrogen. This review uniquely emphasises the different colour codes of hydrogen, which have been rarely discussed in the literature to date. Hydrogen production methods are classified by colour codes, with green hydrogen, produced from renewable sources such as wind and solar, being the most desirable option. The demand for green hydrogen across various sectors is expected to surge. This review comprehensively evaluates the major hydrogen production methods based on cost, environmental impact, and technological maturity. Recent data confirm the increased efficiency, cost-competitiveness, and scalability of green hydrogen production technologies. The cost of green hydrogen has declined significantly, making it competitive with blue hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels with carbon capture). The review also scrutinises several recent hydrogen production technologies, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and technological readiness. Among these, the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) currently outperforms others, with anion exchange membrane (AEM) and electrified steam methane reforming (ESMR) also showing promise. This review also succinctly summarises global progress in hydrogen infrastructure and policies. By spotlighting the diverse colour codes of hydrogen and discussing the crucial takeaways and implications for the future, this review offers a comprehensive overview of the hydrogen energy landscape. This unique focus enriches the literature and enhances our understanding of hydrogen as a promising energy source.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Zainal","given":"Bidattul Syirat"},{"family":"Ker","given":"Pin Jern"},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Hassan"},{"family":"Ong","given":"Hwai Chyuan"},{"family":"Fattah","given":"I.

The vast combinatorial space of element substitutions in alloy electrocatalysts offers a wealth of candidate materials, but presents a significant challenge in terms of experimental and computational exploration of all possible options. Recent scientific and technological developments in machine learning (ML) have offered a new opportunity to accelerate such electrocatalyst materials design. Herein, by incorporating both the electronic and structural properties of alloys, we are able to construct accurate and efficient ML models and predict high-performance alloy catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We have identified the light gradient boosting (LGB) algorithm as the best-performed method, with an excellent coefficient of determination (R2) value reaching 0.921 and the corresponding root-mean-square error (RMSE) being 0.224 eV. The average marginal contributions of alloy features towards ΔGH* values are estimated to determine the importance of various features during the prediction processes. Our results indicate that both the electronic properties of constituent elements and the structural adsorption site features play the most critical roles in the ΔGH* prediction. Furthermore, 84 potential alloys with |ΔGH*| values less than 0.1 eV are successfully screened out of 2290 candidates selected from the Material Project (MP) database. It is reasonable to expect that the ML models with structural and electronic feature engineering developed in this work would provide new insights in future electrocatalyst developments for the HER and other heterogeneous reactions.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jingzi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuelin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xuyan"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Chengquan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiakai"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Kailong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Xi"}],"citation-key":"zhangAccurateEfficientMachine2023","container-title":"Nanoscale","DOI":"10.1039/D3NR01442H","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"11072-11082","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","title":"Accurate and efficient machine learning models for predicting hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts based on structural and electronic feature engineering in alloys","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D3NR01442H","volume":"15"},{"id":"zhangCathodeCatalystLayer2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":", Reducing the use\nof platinum group metals is crucial\nfor the large-scale\ndeployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis systems.\nThe optimization of the cathode catalyst layer and decrease of the\ncathode Pt loading are usually overlooked due to the predominant focus\nof research on the anode.

The inhomogeneous structure of the CLs is formed during the manufacturing process, which is sensitive to the associated materials, composition, fabrication methods, procedures, and conditions.

This escalation poses a critical challenge for waste management and raises considerable environmental concerns. One pivotal solution is the conversion of this wet waste into valuable energy resources and carbon-neutral mediums, a strategy aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15) - Life on Land. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and pyrolysis have emerged as effective technologies due to their ability to process large volumes of wet waste and convert it into energy-rich and carbon-stable products with high energy efficiency. This study introduces a novel framework incorporating advanced machine learning techniques (including deep neural networks, random forest, and eXtreme gradient boosting) with dual-objective optimization. This approach enables a comparative analysis of the solid products from HTC and pyrolysis, focusing on their Carbon Stability Index (CSI) and Return on Energy Investment (REI) index. This assessment enables the tailoring of char production towards specific applications, yielding optimal conditions for high energy efficiency and stable carbon sequestration. In a case study involving wet food waste, the analysis indicated a significant enhancement from 4.83 to 14.43 in REI and an increase from 47.4 to 57.98 in CSI compared to conventional HTC solutions. Moreover, the uncertainty analysis demonstrated that our machine learning-based model provides robust and reliable predictions, with most of the R-squared (R2) values exceeding 0.90, meeting or exceeding the R2 values reported in similar ML models of biomass conversion in the literature, reinforcing its potential for practical applications. Our study also plots the solid products in a Van Krevelen diagram, showing composition changes during conversion.

It is discussed whether the gas should be compressed in subsequent gas compressors or by the electrolyzer. While gas compressor stages can be reduced in the case of electrochemical compression, safety problems arise for thin membranes due to the undesired permeation of hydrogen across the membrane to the oxygen side, forming an explosive gas. In this study, a PEM system is modeled to evaluate the membrane-specific total system efficiency. The optimum efficiency is given depending on the external heat requirement, permeation, cell pressure, current density, and membrane thickness. It shows that the heat requirement and hydrogen permeation dominate the maximum efficiency below 1.6 V, while, above, the cell polarization is decisive. In addition, a pressure-optimized cell operation is introduced by which the optimum cathode pressure is set as a function of current density and membrane thickness. This approach indicates that thin membranes do not provide increased safety issues compared to thick membranes. However, operating an N212-based system instead of an N117-based one can generate twice the amount of hydrogen at the same system efficiency while only one compressor stage must be added.","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en13030612","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"3","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"number: 3\npublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","page":"612","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Improving the Efficiency of PEM Electrolyzers through Membrane-Specific Pressure Optimization","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/3/612","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Scheepers","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Stähler","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Stähler","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Rauls","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Carmo","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Lehnert","given":"Werner"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"citation-key":"scheepersImprovingEfficiencyPEM2020a","library":"My Library","citekey":"scheepersImprovingEfficiencyPEM2020a"},{"id":"maclaurinRenewableEnergyPotential2021","type":"report","language":"en","note":"DOI: 10.2172/1563140","number":"NREL/TP--6A20-73067, 1563140, MainId:13369","page":"NREL/TP--6A20-73067, 1563140, MainId:13369","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Renewable Energy Potential (reV) Model: A Geospatial Platform for Technical Potential and Supply Curve Modeling","title-short":"The Renewable Energy Potential (reV) Model","URL":"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1563140/","author":[{"family":"Maclaurin","given":"Galen"},{"family":"Grue","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Heimiller","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Rossol","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Buster","given":"Grant"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Travis"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"citation-key":"maclaurinRenewableEnergyPotential2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"maclaurinRenewableEnergyPotential2021"},{"id":"mohammadiSurrogateModelingSolving2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The optimal power flow (OPF) problem, characterized by its inherent complexity and strict constraints, has traditionally been approached using analytical techniques. OPF enhances power system sustainability by minimizing operational costs, reducing emissions, and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources through optimized resource allocation and environmentally aligned constraints. However, the evolving nature of power grids, including the integration of distributed generation (DG), increasing uncertainties, changes in topology, and load variability, demands more frequent OPF solutions from grid operators. While conventional methods remain effective, their efficiency and accuracy degrade as computational demands increase. To address these limitations, there is growing interest in the use of data-driven surrogate models. This paper presents a critical review of such models, discussing their limitations and the solutions proposed in the literature. It introduces both Analytical Surrogate Models (ASMs) and learned surrogate models (LSMs) for OPF, providing a thorough analysis of how they can be applied to solve both DC and AC OPF problems. The review also evaluates the development of LSMs for OPF, from initial implementations addressing specific aspects of the problem to more advanced approaches capable of handling topology changes and contingencies. End-to-end and hybrid LSMs are compared based on their computational efficiency, generalization capabilities, and accuracy, and detailed insights are provided. This study includes an empirical comparison of two ASMs and LSMs applied to the IEEE standard six-bus system, demonstrating the key distinctions between these models for small-scale grids and discussing the scalability of LSMs for more complex systems. This comprehensive review aims to serve as a critical resource for OPF researchers and academics, facilitating progress in energy efficiency and providing guidance on the future direction of OPF solution methodologies.","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su16229851","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"22","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"number: 22\npublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","page":"9851","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Surrogate Modeling for Solving OPF: A Review","title-short":"Surrogate Modeling for Solving OPF","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/22/9851","volume":"16","author":[{"family":"Mohammadi","given":"Sina"},{"family":"Bui","given":"Van-Hai"},{"family":"Su","given":"Wencong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bin"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"citation-key":"mohammadiSurrogateModelingSolving2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"mohammadiSurrogateModelingSolving2024"},{"id":"khattakTechnoeconomicEnvironmentalAnalysis2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"<h2>Abstract</h2><p>Water is an essential requirement for agricultural productivity. In the agriculture sector, electricity generated by conventional sources contributes to a substantial amount of carbon footprints for pumping water through tube wells. Over the past few decades, a transitional shift towards renewable resources has increased leading to decarbonizing the environment and is considered as a viable solution for electricity production. To assist and provide a road map for this paradigm shift, the proposed study presents a techno-economic and environmental analysis of irrigation systems by carrying comparative analysis of both standalone and grid-connected systems based on four independent sites in a developing country. PV system integrated with grid enabling both energy purchase and sale (PV + G<sub>(P</sub><sub>+</sub><sub>S)</sub>), proved to be the most optimal configuration with cost of energy (COE) of $0.056/kWh, $0.059/kWh, $0.061/kWh, and $0.068/kWh while having net present cost (NPC) of $7,908, $20,186, $25,826, and $34,487 for Peshawar, Khyber Agency, Mardan, and Charsadda respectively, over a useful life span of 25 years. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has been carried out based on uncertain variables such as Grid power purchase (GPP) and average solar radiation (GHI) to check the optimality behavior of the system. Results from environmental analysis revealed that (PV+ G<sub>(P</sub><sub>+</sub><sub>S)</sub>) system has a relatively low carbon impact as compared with conventional sources. This configuration also has the ability to prevent excess water extraction by selling any excessive solar PV energy to the grid.

This can have significant impacts on grid operations. Short-term forecasting of wind and solar power generation is uniquely helpful for planning the balance of supply and demand in the electric power system because it allows for a reduction in the uncertainty associated with their output. As a step toward assessing the simultaneous integration of large amounts of wind and solar power, this article investigates the spatial and temporal correlation between wind and solar power forecast errors. The forecast and actual data analyzed are obtained from one of the world’s largest regional variable generation integration studies to date. Multiple spatial and temporal scales (day ahead, 4 h ahead, and 1 h ahead) of forecast errors for the Western Interconnection in the United States are analyzed. A joint probability distribution of wind and solar power forecast errors is estimated using kernel density estimation. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient and mutual information between wind and solar power forecast errors are also evaluated. The results show that wind and solar power forecast errors are inversely correlated, and the correlation between wind and solar power forecast errors becomes stronger as the geographic size of the analyzed region increases. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient is generally less than 0.1 in the case of small geographic regions, while it is generally between 0.15 and 0.6 in the case of large geographic regions. The forecast errors are less correlated on the dayahead timescale, which influences economic operations more than reliability, and more correlated on the 4-h-ahead timescale, where reliability is more impacted by the forecasts. It is also found that the correlation between wind and solar power forecast errors in summer (July) is relatively stronger than in winter (January). The inverse correlation implies that in systems with high penetrations of both wind and solar power, reserves that are held to accommodate the variability of wind or solar power can be at least partially shared. In addition, interesting results are found through time and seasonal variation analyses of wind and solar power forecast errors, and these insights may be uniquely useful to operators who maintain the reliability of the electric power system.

Fuel cell performance and durability are critically determined by the mechanical and chemical degradation of a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane. However, how the degree of chemical decomposition affects the material constitutive behavior has not been clearly defined. To estimate the degradation level quantitatively, fluoride release is measured. The PFSA membrane in tensile testing shows nonlinear behavior, which is modeled by J2 plasticity-based material modeling. The material parameters, which contain hardening parameters and Young’s modulus, are characterized in terms of fluoride release levels by inverse analysis. In the sequel, membrane modeling is performed to investigate the life prediction due to humidity cycling. A continuum-based pinhole growth model is adopted in response to mechanical stress. As a result, validation is conducted in comparison with the accelerated stress test (AST) by correlating the size of the pinhole with the gas crossover generated in the membrane. This work provides a dataset of degraded membranes for performance and suggests the quantitative understanding and prediction of fuel cell durability with computational simulation.","container-title":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","DOI":"10.1021/acsami.2c15451","ISSN":"1944-8244","issue":"20","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Appl.

This paper offers a comprehensive review of HES, emphasizing their diverse applications and economic viability. By 2030, hydrogen energy is expected to revolutionize various sectors, significantly impacting CO2 abatement and energy demand. In electricity and power generation, hydrogen could reduce CO2 emissions by 50–100 million tons annually, requiring 10–20 million tons of hydrogen and an investment of $50–100 billion, underscoring its role in grid stabilization. Additionally, in the heating sector, hydrogen could facilitate a CO2 abatement of 30–50 million tons. We examine the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) production, influenced by factors like production methods, efficiency, and infrastructure. While steam methane reforming is cost-effective, it poses a larger environmental impact compared to electrolysis. The global life-cycle cost of hydrogen production decreases as production scales up, with current costs ranging from $1–3 per kg for fossil-based sources to $3.4–7.5 per kg for electrolysis using low-emission electricity. These costs are projected to decrease, especially for electrolytic hydrogen in regions with abundant solar energy. However, despite the technical feasibility of decarbonization, high production costs still pose challenges. A systematic and effective transition to a hydrogen economy requires comprehensive policy and financial support mechanisms, including incentives, subsidies, tax measures, and funding for research and development of pilot projects. Additionally, the paper discusses hydrogen's role in advanced storage technologies such as hydrides and Japan's ENE-FARM solution for residential energy, emphasizing the need for strategic investments across the hydrogen value chain to enhance HES competitiveness, reduce LCOH, and advance the learning rates of hydrogen production technologies.","container-title":"Innovation and Green Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.igd.2024.100149","ISSN":"2949-7531","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Innovation and Green Development","page":"100149","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Advancements in hydrogen energy systems: A review of levelized costs, financial incentives and technological innovations","title-short":"Advancements in hydrogen energy systems","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949753124000262","volume":"3","author":[{"family":"Nyangon","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Darekar","given":"Ayesha"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,1]]},"citation-key":"nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"nyangonAdvancementsHydrogenEnergy2024"},{"id":"zhangBlockchainbasedLifeCycle2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely used for assessing the environmental impacts of a product or service.

Nevertheless, how to produce and procure hydrogen is a challenging issue. In the short term, hydrogen resources will be domestic by-product hydrogen and steam reforming of fossil fuel. Import of hydrogen by means of energy carriers such as liquefied hydrogen and organic hydride (methylcyclohexane) is also being studied by the private sector in anticipation of the future when hydrogen demand will increase. One of the important activities to establish a world hydrogen supply network is the development of CO2-free hydrogen import. However, relying on import inherently carries with it persisting issues such as hydrogen price volatility, uncertainty of stable supply and national wealth leakage. On the other hand, hydrogen production from domestic renewable energy has an advantage in that these issues can be avoided, though there are technological barriers such as the input power variability tolerance of the electrolyzer. Hydrogen production from surplus variable renewable electricity (surplus power type) is recently drawing much attention as a grid integration measure and, in Germany, many pilot projects are being carried out as “Power to Gas.” However, the low load factor of the surplus electricity causes higher cost for hydrogen production. Meanwhile, by using the stable part of variable renewable electricity defined as the bottom part of variable renewable power output that is less affected by variability and by which relatively stable power can be supplied (referred to as stable power type), the production cost can be reduced due to the higher capacity factor of the electrolyzer.","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Economic Analysis of Hydrogen Production from Variable Renewables","author":[{"family":"Shibata","given":"Yoshiaki"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"citation-key":"shibataEconomicAnalysisHydrogen2015","library":"My Library","citekey":"shibataEconomicAnalysisHydrogen2015"},{"id":"baralTechnoeconomicAssessmentGreen2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This study aims to determine the most cost-effective approach for production of green hydrogen, a crucial element for global decarbonization efforts despite its high production costs.

The analysis reveals that MOE, despite its ongoing development, offers a promising route for iron production given its ability to process a wide range of ore qualities and the potential to sell electrolyte as a cement product. However, the best balance between deployment ready technology and economic benefit is AHE. Operational challenges are also discussed, such as electrolyte loss and slag handling.

A 10 MW proton exchange membrane electrolysis process is modelled with a heat recovery system coupled with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to drive the mechanical compression of hydrogen. The technical results demonstrate that when implementing waste heat recovery coupled with an ORC, the first-law efficiency of electrolyser increases from 71.4% to 98%. The ORC can generate sufficient power to drive the hydrogen's compression from the outlet pressure at the electrolyser 30 bar, up to 200 bar. An economic analysis is conducted to calculate the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of system and assess the feasibility of implementing waste heat recovery coupled with ORC. The results reveal that electricity prices dominate the LCOH. When electricity prices are low (e.g., dedicated offshore wind electricity), the LCOH is higher when implementing heat recovery. The additional capital expenditure and operating expenditure associated with the ORC increases the LCOH and these additional costs outweigh the savings generated by not purchasing electricity for compression. On the other hand, heat recovery and ORC become attractive and feasible when grid electricity prices are higher.","container-title":"Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121333","ISSN":"0306-2619","journalAbbreviation":"Applied Energy","page":"121333","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-economic analysis of large-scale green hydrogen production and storage","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261923006979","volume":"346","author":[{"family":"María Villarreal Vives","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruiqi"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Sumit"},{"family":"Smallbone","given":"Andrew"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,15]]},"citation-key":"mariavillarrealvivesTechnoeconomicAnalysisLargescale2023a","library":"My Library","citekey":"mariavillarrealvivesTechnoeconomicAnalysisLargescale2023a"},{"id":"fabianekTechnoeconomicAnalysisOptimal2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The aim of this study is to assess the economic potentials of power and hydrogen generation via solar and wind energy resources at locations in Northern Germany and California, both of these (geographical) regions being pioneers in terms of a sustainable energy transition. Based on extensive research and electrolyzer manufacturer interviews, green hydrogen generation plants are modeled in a MATLAB® environment. All relevant inputs and outputs of the systems studied (wind power plants, photovoltaic power plants, and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers, among others) are considered for different locations and framework conditions. In contrast to the existing literature, special attention is paid to the part-load behavior of electrolysis systems, which becomes particularly relevant in their interplay with volatile renewables. Metrics such as the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of the wind and photovoltaic power plants and the resulting levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOHy) are determined. With the help of the developed model, dimensioning of a whole system's components can be determined for different locations. A case study is conducted for a Northern German site and another one for a site in the Californian Mojave Desert. Both the optimal dimensioning of the renewable energy plants and the ratio of installed wind and photovoltaic power plant capacity are strongly location-dependent. In Northern Germany, for example, lower LCOHy can be generated at higher wind power plant capacity shares and, in the Mojave Desert, be produced at higher photovoltaic power plant capacity shares. In general, with larger plants and correspondingly larger polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers, LCOHy are lower due to scaling effects. Following this dimensioning recommendation, the LCOHy vary between 4.5 €/kg and 5.2 €/kg in the Northern German case study and between 4.6 US$/kg and 5.3 US$/kg in the Californian one. With costs of 1–2 €/kg, gray hydrogen is still economically superior.","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.11.196","ISSN":"0360-3199","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","page":"1157-1172","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-economic analysis and optimal sizing of hybrid PV-wind systems for hydrogen production by PEM electrolysis in California and Northern Germany","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319923059414","volume":"67","author":[{"family":"Fabianek","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Madlener","given":"Reinhard"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"citation-key":"fabianekTechnoeconomicAnalysisOptimal2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"fabianekTechnoeconomicAnalysisOptimal2024"},{"id":"TechnoeconomicalAnalysisProduction","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Techno-economical analysis on the production of hydrogen","citation-key":"TechnoeconomicalAnalysisProduction","library":"My Library","citekey":"TechnoeconomicalAnalysisProduction"},{"id":"egeland-eriksenTechnoeconomicAnalysisEffect2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The cost of green hydrogen production is very dependent on the price of electricity. A control system that can schedule hydrogen production based on forecast wind speed and electricity price should therefore be advanta­ geous for large-scale wind-hydrogen systems. This work presents a novel price-based control system integrated in a techno-economic analysis of hydrogen production from offshore wind. A polynomial regression model that predicts wind power production from wind speed input was developed and tested with real-world datasets from a 2.3 MW floating offshore wind turbine. This was combined with a mathematical model of a PEM electrolyzer and used to simulate hydrogen production. A novel price-based control system was developed to decide when the system should produce hydrogen and when it should sell electricity to the grid. The model and control system can be used in real-world wind-hydrogen systems and require only the forecast wind speed, electricity price and selling price of hydrogen as inputs. 11 test scenarios based on 10 years of real-world wind speed and electricity price data are proposed and used to evaluate the effect the price-based control system has on the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Both current and future (2050) costs and technologies are used, and the results show that the novel control system lowered the LCOH in all scenarios by 10–46%. The lowest LCOH achieved with current technology and costs was 6.04 $/kg H2. Using the most optimistic forecasts for technology improvements and cost reductions in 2050, the model estimated a LCOH of 0.96 $/kg H2 for a grid-connected offshore wind farm and onshore hydrogen production, 0.82 $/kg H2 using grid electricity (onshore) and 4.96 $/kg H2 with an offgrid offshore wind-hydrogen system.

These results indicate that it is not a viable option, however, with the implementation of specific policies, it could be financially profitable to use green hydrogen production to alleviate grid congestion, but its primary purpose should be to sell green hydrogen and increase its share in the Netherlands.","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"TITLE: TECHNO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION USING DRENTHE AS CASE STUDY.","author":[{"family":"Slootweg","given":"Han"},{"family":"Romijn","given":"Henny"}],"citation-key":"slootwegTITLETECHNOECONOMICANALYSIS","library":"My Library","citekey":"slootwegTITLETECHNOECONOMICANALYSIS"},{"id":"TechnoeconomicalAnalysisProductiona","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Techno-economical analysis on the production of hydrogen","citation-key":"TechnoeconomicalAnalysisProductiona","library":"My Library","citekey":"TechnoeconomicalAnalysisProductiona"},{"id":"chungTechnoEconomicAssessmentElectrolytic","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Green hydrogen has an important role to play in the future decarbonized world as it has the potential to decarbonize many sectors of the economy. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is one of the production pathways for green hydrogen. This study uses a techno-economic optimization model that combines a high-level electrolyzer model and a cost model to evaluate the current (2021) and future (2040) economics of running a PEM electrolyzer under various operating conditions, including dynamic operations and differential-pressure operations. The results show that dynamic operation can reduce the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 9% compared to steady operation at a nominal current density. Using direct electrochemical compression without the need for a mechanical compressor is an economically viable solution in the future, while a hybrid approach is preferred in the current scenario. Finally, the LCOH projections show that continued efforts to reduce the capital cost, improve the electrolyzer performance, and integrate more low-cost renewables into the electricity market are necessary for green hydrogen to reach cost-parity with hydrocarbon-based hydrogen.","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Techno-Economic Assessment of Electrolytic Hydrogen Production under Dynamic Operations","author":[{"family":"Chung","given":"Doo Hyun Mark"}],"citation-key":"chungTechnoEconomicAssessmentElectrolytic","library":"My Library","citekey":"chungTechnoEconomicAssessmentElectrolytic"},{"id":"ueckerdtCostCompetitivenessBlue2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Despite the cost reductions of green hydrogen, it is uncertain when cost parity with blue hydrogen will be achieved. Beyond technology costs, electricity and natural gas prices, hydrogen’s competitiveness will be increasingly determined by carbon costs or regulation associated with its life-cycle emissions. Theoretically and numerically, we demonstrate that higher residual emissions of blue hydrogen can close its competitive window much earlier than the cost parity of green hydrogen suggests. In regions where natural gas prices remain substantially higher (∼40 EUR/MWh) than before the energy crisis, such a window is narrow or has already closed. While blue hydrogen could potentially bridge the scarcity of green hydrogen, uncertainties about the beginning and end of blue hydrogen competitiveness may hinder investments. In contrast, in regions where natural gas prices drop to ≤15 EUR/MWh, blue hydrogen can remain competitive until at least 2040, contingent upon achieving rigorous CO2 capture (>90%) and negligible methane leakage rates (<1%).","container-title":"Joule","DOI":"10.1016/j.joule.2023.12.004","ISSN":"2542-4351","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Joule","page":"104-128","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the cost competitiveness of blue and green hydrogen","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435123004968","volume":"8","author":[{"family":"Ueckerdt","given":"Falko"},{"family":"Verpoort","given":"Philipp C."},{"family":"Anantharaman","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Beck","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Longden","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Roussanaly","given":"Simon"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"citation-key":"ueckerdtCostCompetitivenessBlue2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"ueckerdtCostCompetitivenessBlue2024"},{"id":"spaargarenComparativeStudyRegulation1976","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.

Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence suggests these technologies form an attractive option for the deep decarbonisation of global energy systems, and that recent improvements in their cost and performance point towards economic viability as well. This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential role that hydrogen could play in the provision of electricity, heat, industry, transport and energy storage in a low-carbon energy system, and an assessment of the status of hydrogen in being able to fulfil that potential. The picture that emerges is one of qualified promise: hydrogen is well established in certain niches such as forklift trucks, while mainstream applications are now forthcoming. Hydrogen vehicles are available commercially in several countries, and 225 000 fuel cell home heating systems have been sold. This represents a step change from the situation of only five years ago. This review shows that challenges around cost and performance remain, and considerable improvements are still required for hydrogen to become truly competitive. But such competitiveness in the medium-term future no longer seems an unrealistic prospect, which fully justifies the growing interest and policy support for these technologies around the world.","container-title":"Energy & Environmental Science","DOI":"10.1039/C8EE01157E","ISSN":"1754-5706","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Environ.

In both cases increasing temperature seems to be an option. In this work, similarities and differences of the temperature-dependence of the kinetic overpotential of the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions are investigated. While both overpotentials decrease with temperature, only in PEWE a significant cell performance gain is obtained at relevant current densities due to the decreasing reversible thermodynamic cell voltage with temperature. Furthermore, for both reactions, the corresponding activation energies at constant overpotentials and constant cell voltages are determined according to the Butler-Volmer equation and transition state theory. At constant overpotentials a similar decrease in the activation energy from equilibrium conditions (approx. 67 kJ/mol) to an overpotential of about 0.3 V (approx. 40 kJ/mol) is observed and considered as a coincidence. That is, the activation energy of the supposed rate determining steps behaves similar with increasing the OER/ORR overpotential. Considering the technically important situation of constant cell voltage, the activation energy for PEFC is decreasing more rapidly due to the temperature induced decrease of the reversible thermodynamic cell voltage.","container-title":"Electrochimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.150","ISSN":"0013-4686","journalAbbreviation":"Electrochimica Acta","page":"466-471","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparing the kinetic activation energy of the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468618312052","volume":"281","author":[{"family":"Suermann","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Büchi","given":"Felix N."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,10]]},"citation-key":"suermannComparingKineticActivation2018","library":"My Library","citekey":"suermannComparingKineticActivation2018"},{"id":"debeInitialPerformanceDurability2012","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of The Electrochemical Society","DOI":"10.1149/2.065206jes","ISSN":"0013-4651, 1945-7111","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Renewable energy is an effective means of reducing CO2 emissions, but the fluctuation in demand and production of energy is a limiting factor. Liquid hydrogen allows for long-term storage of energy. Hydrogen quality is important for the safety and efficiency of the end user. Furthermore, the quality of the hydrogen gas after liquefaction has not yet been reported. The purity of hydrogen after liquefaction was assessed against the specification of Hydrogen grade D in the ISO-14687:2019 by analysing samples taken at different locations throughout production. Sampling was carried out directly in gas cylinders, and purity was assessed using multiple analytical methods. The results indicate that the hydrogen gas produced from liquefaction is of a higher purity than the starting gas, with all impurities below the threshold values set in ISO-14687:2019. The amount fraction of water measured in the hydrogen sample increased with repeated sampling from the liquid hydrogen tank, suggesting that the sampling system used was affected by low temperatures (−253 °C). These data demonstrate for the first time the impact of liquefaction on hydrogen purity assessed against ISO-14687:2019, showing that liquified hydrogen is a viable option for long-term energy storage whilst also improving quality.","container-title":"Processes","DOI":"10.3390/pr10091697","ISSN":"2227-9717","issue":"9","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"number: 9\npublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","page":"1697","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Impact of Hydrogen Liquefaction on Hydrogen Fuel Quality for Transport Applications (ISO-14687:2019)","title-short":"Impact of Hydrogen Liquefaction on Hydrogen Fuel Quality for Transport Applications (ISO-14687","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/9/1697","volume":"10","author":[{"family":"Hookham","given":"Mathew J.
