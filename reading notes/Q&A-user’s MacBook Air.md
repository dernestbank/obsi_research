# is PEM electrolyzer diffusion limit or reaction limited?

PEM electrolyzer can be limited by both diffusion and reaction kinetics, depending on the operating conditions and cell design. 
At high current densities transport limitations becomes dominant


### Mass Transport Limitations

At high current densities, PEM electrolyzers face mass transport challenges:
1. Water supply: Limitations in delivering reactant water to the anode catalyst layer[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79935-6)[2](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10140633/3/Maier_ReviewMassTransportPEMWE_Reviewed_Unmarked.pdf).
2. Gas removal: Difficulty in removing produced oxygen and hydrogen gases from the catalyst layers[2](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10140633/3/Maier_ReviewMassTransportPEMWE_Reviewed_Unmarked.pdf)[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9921346/).
    
These mass transport issues lead to concentration overpotentials, requiring increased voltage to maintain high current densities[2](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10140633/3/Maier_ReviewMassTransportPEMWE_Reviewed_Unmarked.pdf).

### Reaction Kinetics

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is typically the rate-limiting step in PEM electrolyzers due to its slow kinetics[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3293/3/4/40). This is why PEM electrolyzers use high loadings of precious metal catalysts like IrO2 at the anode (1-5 mg·cm−2) compared to the cathode (0.4-0.8 mg·cm−2 of Pt)[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3293/3/4/40).

### Interplay of Limitations

1. Low to moderate current densities: Reaction kinetics are the primary limiting factor.
2. High current densities: Mass transport becomes increasingly limiting[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79935-6)[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9921346/).
    

### Factors Affecting Limitations

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures generally improve both reaction kinetics and mass transport[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9921346/).
2. Pressure: Can affect mass transport, particularly gas removal[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9921346/).
3. Flow field design: Impacts water distribution and gas removal[2](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10140633/3/Maier_ReviewMassTransportPEMWE_Reviewed_Unmarked.pdf).
4. Catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer (GDL) properties: Affect both reaction sites and mass transport pathways[5](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00904)[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3293/3/4/40).

# Energy content / Heating Value
## HHV and LHV which is preferred for for electrolyser efficiency calculations


THe choice depends on the technology , operational context and industry standards.

Depends on whether the latent of vapourization of water vapour during the combustion is applied.'
HHV includes this heat whiles LHV does not include this heat.
Application: LHV: fuel cell, 
HHV is the total energy released whiles the LHV is the usable energy available for application.
The difference is 18%



### Thermodynamic Foundations of HHV and LHV

### Definitions and Key Differences

The **higher heating value (HHV)** represents the total energy released during hydrogen combustion, including the latent heat of vaporization when water vapor condenses to liquid. In contrast, the **lower heating value (LHV)** excludes this latent heat, assuming water remains in vapor form post-combustion[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf)[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_in-this-post-i-discuss-lhv-vs-hhv-cell-activity-7160588082855972866-Xjid). Mathematically:

HHV=LHV+Heat of vaporization of water

For hydrogen, HHV is approximately 39.5 kWh/kg (141.7 MJ/kg), while LHV is 33.3 kWh/kg (120 MJ/kg)[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf)[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_in-this-post-i-discuss-lhv-vs-hhv-cell-activity-7160588082855972866-Xjid). This distinction becomes critical in electrolysis efficiency calculations, where the choice of heating value directly impacts reported performance metrics.

### Energy Input Considerations

Electrolysis requires both electrical energy to split water and thermal energy to overcome entropic losses:

H2O (liquid)+237.2 kJ/mol (electricity)+48.6 kJ/mol (heat)→H2+12O2H2O (liquid)+237.2 kJ/mol (electricity)+48.6 kJ/mol (heat)→H2+21O2

In low-temperature electrolysers like proton exchange membrane (PEM) and alkaline systems, resistive losses within the cell provide the necessary heat[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf). High-temperature electrolysers (HTEs), however, often utilize external waste heat, reducing electrical energy demand[5](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC128292/JRC128292_01.pdf). These operational differences mandate careful selection of HHV or LHV to avoid efficiency misinterpretation.

## Efficiency Metrics in Electrolysis Technologies

## PEM Electrolysers

PEM systems operate at 70–90°C, where water enters as liquid but interacts with catalysts as steam[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis). Since the process inherently recovers waste heat for vaporization, **HHV is the standard reference** for PEM efficiency calculations[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis)[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_in-this-post-i-discuss-lhv-vs-hhv-cell-activity-7160588082855972866-Xjid). This accounts for the steam-phase reactant and aligns with the system’s ability to utilize internal heat. For example, Wikipedia notes PEM Electrolyzer achieve ~80% efficiency based on HHV[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis), as the thermoneutral voltage (Eth=1.48 VEth=1.48 V) includes both electrical and thermal contributions[1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_hydrogen-electrolysers-efficiency-lhv-or-activity-7099706809854169088-h9Fy)[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_in-this-post-i-discuss-lhv-vs-hhv-cell-activity-7160588082855972866-Xjid).

## High-Temperature Electrolysers (HTEs)

Solid oxide electrolysers (SOEs) operating above 700°C leverage external heat sources, such as industrial waste heat or nuclear reactors[5](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC128292/JRC128292_01.pdf). These systems often adopt **HHV-based efficiency** because the high temperatures enable steam utilization and heat integration, reducing electrical energy demand[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf)[5](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC128292/JRC128292_01.pdf). For instance, HTEs can achieve efficiencies exceeding 90% (HHV) when paired with cogeneration plants[5](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC128292/JRC128292_01.pdf).


## Industry Practices and Standards

### Green vs. Blue Hydrogen

- **Green hydrogen (renewable-powered):** LHV is commonly used, particularly in Europe, to align with International Energy Agency (IEA) standards[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf). This avoids overestimating efficiency in grid-connected systems where external heat inputs are negligible.
- **Blue hydrogen (with carbon capture):** HHV is often preferred because steam methane reforming (SMR) plants recover waste heat, mirroring the thermal integration seen in HTEs[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf)[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_in-this-post-i-discuss-lhv-vs-hhv-cell-activity-7160588082855972866-Xjid).
    

### Regional Variations

- **North America:** HHV is frequently used for PEM and HTE systems to reflect steam utilization and compatibility with industrial gas standards[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_in-this-post-i-discuss-lhv-vs-hhv-cell-activity-7160588082855972866-Xjid).
- **Europe:** LHV dominates green hydrogen reporting to ensure conservative efficiency estimates and harmonize with fuel cell metrics[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf).
    

## Efficiency Calculation Methodologies

## Faraday Efficiency vs. System Efficiency

Faraday efficiency (εF) measures the ratio of actual hydrogen production to theoretical maximum[1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonamiri_hydrogen-electrolysers-efficiency-lhv-or-activity-7099706809854169088-h9Fy):

εF=m˙rem˙idεF=m˙idm˙re

System efficiency (εSysεSys), however, incorporates balance-of-plant losses (e.g., AC/DC conversion, cooling):

εSys=V˙H2⋅HHV/LHVPel, ACεSys=Pel, ACV˙H2⋅HHV/LHV

Using HHV in this equation inflates efficiency values compared to LHV. For example, a PEM electrolyser with 80% HHV efficiency would equate to ~67% LHV efficiency[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_electrolysis)[4](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-053-ETC-Hydrogen-Technical-Annex-Final_.pdf).





# Thermoneutral vrs Reversible energy
**Reversible voltage:**

- Represents the ideal voltage needed to start a reaction without any energy losses due to resistance or overpotential. 
- Can be calculated using the Nernst equation based on the thermodynamic properties of the reaction.

- **Thermoneutral voltage:**
    
    - Occurs when the heat produced by the reaction perfectly balances the heat consumed, leading to a thermally neutral state. 
    - For water electrolysis, the thermoneutral voltage is typically around 1.48 volts under standard conditions. 
    - Operating above the thermoneutral voltage results in excess heat generation, which needs to be managed.

# What are the possible reaction engineering question that can come from this.


# Question on model

## Is this a 2-D or 1-D model


## How is degradation accounted for in your model

Cation (Na⁺, Ca²⁺) from impure water can occupy sulfonate sites, reducing proton conductivity and water content. This can be modeled as an additional **resistance** or a loss of active acid sites. 
One way to incorporate fouling is to gradually decrease $λ_{\text{max}}$ or $\kappa_{\text{mem}}$ over time, or add a fixed resistive term $R_{\text{foul}}$. For example, if calcium contamination leads to 10% of sulfonate sites being blocked, one might multiply conductivity by 0.9 to simulate it.



## Why series cell arrangements
A single path for current flow
Basis is on a current density design
Total voltage drop is the sum of the voltage drop across the series.

Preference for a series because of simplicity, controlled current flow,
suitable for a single controlled current flow

Advantages
	Simplicity of design
	Voltage division
	perfect for a modular system design

Downside-
	Difficult to repair - one breaks down all collapse
	Overheating problems


- **What are the objectives of your model?** (e.g., predict performance, optimize design, study specific phenomena, system-level simulation?)
- **What level of detail does your model include?** (e.g., 0D ( lumped parameter), 1D, 2D, 3D?)
- **What physical phenomena does your model account for?** (e.g., electrochemistry, mass transport, heat transport, fluid dynamics, membrane phenomena, electrical resistance?)
- **What are the key equations or principles your model is based on?** (e.g., Butler-Volmer equation, Fick's law, conservation equations?)
- **What components of the electrolyzer does the model include?** (e.g., membrane, catalyst layers (anode and cathode), gas diffusion layers (GDLs), bipolar plates, flow channels?)
- **What assumptions have you made in developing the model?**
- **What inputs does your model require?** (e.g., operating voltage, current density, temperature, pressure, flow rates, material properties?)
- **What outputs does your model provide?** (e.g., hydrogen production rate, efficiency, temperature distribution, species concentrations, voltage losses?)

**Model Simplifications (Fluid Dynamics):** Implementing full 2D or 3D fluid dynamics coupled with the other phenomena is very complex. In a 2D model, fluid dynamics in the flow channels might need to be simplified (e.g., using analytical solutions for pressure drop and velocity profiles, or a porous media approach for the GDLs/catalyst layers). Clearly defining how fluid flow is handled and coupled is critical.

**Two-Phase Flow:** Water management is a major challenge in PEM electrolyzers. Modeling the transport and behavior of both liquid water and gas phases (hydrogen and oxygen) in the porous GDLs and flow channels, including phase change, is complex in 2D. How will you handle two-phase flow phenomena like flooding and bubble formation, especially on the anode side with oxygen evolution?

**Boundary Conditions and Interfaces:** Carefully defining appropriate boundary conditions at the edges of your 2D domain and interface conditions between the different layers (membrane, catalyst layers, GDLs, bipolar plates) is crucial for the model's accuracy.

**Coupling Schemes:** The different physical phenomena are strongly coupled. You'll need a robust numerical scheme to solve the coupled system of PDEs simultaneously or iteratively. Choosing an appropriate solver and coupling strategy is vital for convergence and accuracy.


**Optimization Integration:** How will you integrate this 2D model into an optimization framework? Direct integration might be too slow. You might consider:

- Using the 2D model to generate data for training a simpler surrogate model (e.g., using machine learning) for use in optimization.
- Focusing optimization on parameters that have a significant impact based on 2D model sensitivity analysis.
- Using the 2D model to optimize specific components or designs that are then used in a simpler system-level model.

- **System-Level Simulation Integration:** Similarly, incorporating a detailed 2D model into a system-level simulation (which might include compressors, purifiers, power electronics, etc.) requires careful consideration. The 2D model could provide performance curves or lookup tables to the system model rather than being simulated in real-time within the system.
- **Catalyst Layer Structure:** The detailed microstructure of the catalyst layer (ionomer content, platinum loading distribution, pore network) significantly impacts performance. How will your 2D model account for these microstructural effects? This often involves using effective medium theories or incorporating micro-scale phenomena into the larger 2D domain.

- **Numerical Stability and Convergence:** Solving coupled, non-linear PDEs can be prone to numerical stability issues and convergence problems, especially at high current densities or extreme operating conditions. Careful discretization and solver choices are necessary

**Recommendations and Questions for You to Consider:**

- **Specify the 2D Plane:** What plane does your 2D model represent? Is it through the thickness of the MEA and into the flow channel/land? Or is it along the length of the channel and through the MEA thickness? This choice impacts what phenomena are most accurately captured and what simplifications are necessary for others.
- **Fluid Dynamics Simplifications:** How specifically are you modeling fluid flow in the channels and porous layers? (e.g., Navier-Stokes in channels, Brinkman or Darcy in porous media?) How is two-phase flow being handled?
- **Electrochemical Kinetics:** What form of the Butler-Volmer equation or other kinetic expressions are you using? How are activation overpotentials calculated?
- **Membrane Model:** How are you modeling proton conductivity and water transport (electro-osmotic drag, back diffusion) through the membrane as a function of hydration and temperature?
- - **Numerical Method:** What numerical method do you plan to use for solving the PDEs (e.g., Finite Difference, Finite Volume, Finite Element)? Python libraries like FiPy (FD/FV) or FEniCS/Firedrake (FEM) could be very useful here.
- **Validation Plan:** Do you have access to experimental data to validate your model against? How will you approach the validation process?
- **Optimization Strategy:** Have you thought about how the 2D model will be used within the optimization objective function or process?
- **System Integration Strategy:** How will the 2D model's outputs be used by the system-level simulation?

## Which location is your plant located
The 40° N parallel in our study corresponds to the **Great Plains** archetype. In our five‐region breakdown, the Great Plains region is the one centered around 40° N (running through Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, etc.), which is exactly where our “baseline” inland site sits. If you follow 40° N further east over the Atlantic, you’d hit the New York offshore archetype—but for the continental U.S. inland case, it’s the Great Plain
