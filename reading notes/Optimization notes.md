In recent years, researchers have increasingly integrated **optimization methods** into TEA to identify cost-effective and efficient hydrogen production strategies​ [pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2024/EE/D4EE02394C#:~:text=flexibility,of%20evaluating%20new%20and%20emerging)  [pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/ee/d4ee02394c#:~:text=%28i,optimal%20technology%20and%20integration%20options) 
## Applications of Optimization in Green Hydrogen TEA

- Optimization techniques are used in TEA to **identify optimal designs, configurations, or operating strategies** that minimize cost or maximize performance for hydrogen production systems. Common applications include: **System Design and Sizing:** Determining the optimal size and configuration of hydrogen production systems (electrolyzers, renewable power capacity, storage, etc.) to minimize the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). For example, Jiang et al. (2019) optimized the capacity of a coupled wind-hydrogen system to minimize cost​ [pubs.aip.org](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jrse/article/13/4/044101/364102/Business-model-and-planning-approach-for-hydrogen#:~:text=Business%20model%20and%20planning%20approach,7012%3B%20Resources.%20For%20Researchers) . Similarly, a recent study jointly optimized an offshore wind farm layout and electrolyzer capacity to cut LCOH, recognizing that both design aspects affect hydrogen cost​ [ieeexplore.ieee.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904013#:~:text=,the%20wake%20effect%20among). These approaches treat component capacities as decision variables and use cost models from TEA to find minimum-cost designs.
- **Hydrogen Supply Chain Optimization:** Designing hydrogen supply networks (production, transport, storage, distribution) for minimum cost or multi-criteria objectives. Reyes-Barquet _et al._ (2022) presented a multi-objective optimization of a hydrogen supply chain powered by biomass in Mexico​   [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/3/437#:~:text=The%20simultaneous%20optimization%20of%20both,solution%20chosen%20by%20the%20TOPSIS)    [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/3/437#:~:text=The%20solution%20selected%20using%20the,important%20performance%20indicators%20were%20estimated)   their model minimized cost (maximized profit) and greenhouse emissions simultaneously, yielding a **Pareto-optimal** set of network designs. The chosen solution using TOPSIS achieved a high annual profit (~$275 million) with significantly reduced CO₂ emissions​        [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/3/437#:~:text=The%20solution%20selected%20using%20the,important%20performance%20indicators%20were%20estimated). Such case studies highlight how **strategic planning models** use optimization to configure green hydrogen supply chains optimally.
    
- **Operational Optimization in Energy Systems:** TEA of integrated energy systems often incorporates optimization of operation schedules or power flows. For instance, Laky _et al._ (2024) developed a computational optimization framework (using IDAES/Pyomo) for **dynamic market-based TEA** of systems co-producing electricity and hydrogen​   [pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2024/EE/D4EE02394C#:~:text=flexibility,of%20evaluating%20new%20and%20emerging) [pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/ee/d4ee02394c#:~:text=electrification,the%20Design%20of%20Advanced%20Energy). They optimized operations of solid-oxide electrolysis and fuel cell systems to maximize profits under time-varying electricity prices, showing that flexible hydrogen-electricity coproduction can be highly profitable in many scenarios​ [pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/ee/d4ee02394c#:~:text=investigate%20the%20integration%20of%20electricity,with%20high%20levels%20of%20variable)   [pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/ee/d4ee02394c#:~:text=coproduce%20electricity%20and%20hydrogen%20%E2%80%93,technologies%2C%20especially%20flexible%20coproduction%20systems). This **dynamic optimization** approach goes beyond static cost estimation, capturing the value of operating flexibility in TEA.
    
- **Process Parameter Optimization:** In some cases, detailed process models (e.g., in Aspen Plus or MATLAB) are coupled with optimization algorithms to find optimal operating conditions (temperature, pressure, current density, etc.) that improve efficiency or cost. For example, Aspen models of water electrolysis have been linked with optimization algorithms to maximize efficiency while considering cost trade-offs​ [academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/ijlct/article/doi/10.1093/ijlct/ctae295/8029822#:~:text=,Horizon%202020%20research%20and).     Such **techno-economic optimization** ensures that process conditions are tuned for economic objectives, not just technical performance.
incorporating optimization into TEA allows analysts to explore the design space and identify solutions that traditional scenario analysis might miss. It shifts TEA from simply evaluating a given design to actively finding the best design under given assumptions
Applications range from high-level network design to fine-tuning of process parameters, all aiming to **reduce hydrogen production costs and improve system performance**​

## Algorithmic Optimization Methods for Multi-Objective TEA

A variety of algorithmic optimization methods have been employed to handle the **multi-objective** nature of TEA for green hydrogen (e.g. minimizing cost while maximizing efficiency or minimizing emissions). Key types of optimization algorithms include:

- **Mathematical Programming:** Linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer programming are used when the TEA model can be formulated with mathematical constraints. For example, supply chain design problems often use mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to minimize total annual cost of hydrogen delivery​ [cetjournal.it](https://www.cetjournal.it/cet/23/103/118.pdf#:~:text=The%20annual%20total%20cost%20of,with%20maximum%20economic%20performance) . MILP can handle discrete decisions (like facility locations) alongside continuous ones (flow rates). Similarly, **goal programming** methods are applied in multi-objective settings by transforming multiple objectives into a single composite objective or constraints​ [iieta.org](https://iieta.org/journals/jnmes/paper/10.14447/jnmes.v27i2.a04#:~:text=d,commonly%20used%20in%20MCDM%20include)[iieta.org](https://iieta.org/journals/jnmes/paper/10.14447/jnmes.v27i2.a04#:~:text=their%20priorities,objectives%20as%20much%20as%20possible) . These deterministic algorithms guarantee finding an optimal solution given the model, but require the TEA model to be sufficiently well-behaved (e.g. linear or convex for efficient solving).
    
- **Evolutionary Algorithms:** Because hydrogen TEA problems can be highly nonlinear or involve conflicting objectives, evolutionary and swarm-intelligence algorithms are popular. Techniques like the **Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)** have been used to generate Pareto frontiers of hydrogen system designs ​[academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/ijlct/article/doi/10.1093/ijlct/ctae267/8006447#:~:text=,economically%20optimal%20system%20operating%20conditions) . For instance, one study applied NSGA-II to optimize a CO₂-to-hydrogen process for thermo-economic performance, yielding a Pareto set of optimal operating conditions​[academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/ijlct/article/doi/10.1093/ijlct/ctae267/8006447#:~:text=,economically%20optimal%20system%20operating%20conditions)   . Other algorithms include **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** and newer hybrids (e.g. a Grey Wolf Optimizer–PSO hybrid) to solve multi-objective problems in hydrogen production​    [academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/ijlct/article/doi/10.1093/ijlct/ctae295/8029822#:~:text=,Horizon%202020%20research%20and) . These algorithms iterate over generations of candidate solutions, evolving toward better trade-offs without requiring gradient information.
- **Heuristic and Custom Algorithms:** Some studies develop bespoke heuristics or use simulation-based optimization. For instance, the HOMER software (commonly used for hybrid renewable systems) employs an enumerative search heuristic to find the least-cost combination of components​[rera.shahroodut.ac.ir](https://rera.shahroodut.ac.ir/article_2087_29f489ea43b28a2f5e5c3d785fbe3de3.pdf#:~:text=using%20the%20HOMER%20software,Also%20not%20using). In a case study for an off-grid solar–wind–hydrogen system in Iran, HOMER simulation identified the optimal system configuration (yielding an LCOH of $254/kg for the chosen design) and then performed sensitivity analysis on wind and solar inputs​[rera.shahroodut.ac.ir](https://rera.shahroodut.ac.ir/article_2087_29f489ea43b28a2f5e5c3d785fbe3de3.pdf#:~:text=using%20the%20HOMER%20software,Also%20not%20using)[rera.shahroodut.ac.ir](https://rera.shahroodut.ac.ir/article_2087_29f489ea43b28a2f5e5c3d785fbe3de3.pdf#:~:text=intensity%20of%20solar%20radiation%20and,a%20fuel%20cell%20only%20includes). This illustrates that beyond formal solvers, **specialized tools and heuristics** are adapted for TEA optimization.
- **Constraint and Weighted Sum Methods:** A common approach in multi-objective optimization is to convert it into a series of single-objective problems. The **ε-constraint method** optimizes one objective while treating others as constraints that are gradually varied​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/19/3800#:~:text=multi,illustrated%20by%20the%20following%20equation). This was used in a microgrid hydrogen system study: they applied the ε-constraint method to find the Pareto frontier of cost vs. exergy efficiency, then applied TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to select the best compromise solution​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/19/3800#:~:text=efficiency,confirm%20the%20efficacy%20of%20the) [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/19/3800#:~:text=Multi,can%20reduce%20the%20system%E2%80%99s%20economic). Alternatively, a weighted sum of objectives can be optimized if stakeholders can assign weights to cost, emissions, etc. **Multi-objective goal programming (MOGP)** is an example where weights or priority levels guide the search for a solution that “satisfies all objectives as much as possible”​[iieta.org](https://iieta.org/journals/jnmes/paper/10.14447/jnmes.v27i2.a04#:~:text=their%20priorities,objectives%20as%20much%20as%20possible). These methods are straightforward to implement with linear or nonlinear programming solvers, though they require judgment in setting weights or targets.

## Machine Learning vs. Algorithmic Optimization in TEA

Both machine learning (ML) and traditional algorithmic optimization are being used to enhance technoeconomic analyses, but they play different roles. In general, **algorithmic optimization** directly searches for the best solution within a defined model, whereas **machine learning** can assist by modeling complex relationships or providing rapid estimations. A comparison is as follows:

- **Role of Machine Learning in TEA:** ML techniques are used to create **surrogate models** of technoeconomic outcomes or to identify patterns in large parameter spaces. For example, Rodgers _et al._ (2022) developed a machine learning surrogate model to predict the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) for biomass supercritical gasification across various feedstocks and scales​ [discovery.ucl.ac.uk](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10176305/1/1-s2.0-S036031992303923X-main.pdf#:~:text=A%20surrogate%20model%20for%20the,model%20is%20published%20to%20facili) [discovery.ucl.ac.uk](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10176305/1/1-s2.0-S036031992303923X-main.pdf#:~:text=A%20techno,model%20is%20published%20to%20facili)    . They trained and tested several algorithms (random forests, support vector regression, neural networks), finding that an ANN could predict LCOH with high accuracy​ [discovery.ucl.ac.uk](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10176305/1/1-s2.0-S036031992303923X-main.pdf#:~:text=A%20techno,model%20is%20published%20to%20facili). Such a surrogate can then be used in optimization or scenario analysis far more quickly than a first-principles model. In another study, Hu _et al._ (2023) used an **XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) model** as a surrogate for a PEM electrolyzer’s performance within an energy system optimization​  [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/13/1/268#:~:text=algorithm,by%20comparisons%20with%20dispatch%20results) [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/13/1/268#:~:text=XGBoost%20model%20and%20the%20remaining,to%20verify%20the%20accuracy%20and). By learning the nonlinear efficiency curve of the electrolyzer, the surrogate allowed a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the dispatch of a renewable-powered electrolyzer system for minimum cost and emissions​  [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/13/1/268#:~:text=operating%20conditions%20with%20the%20help,fluctuations%20in%20supply%20and%20demand). These cases show ML enabling or accelerating optimization by approximating complex technical behaviors in the TEA.
- **Role of Algorithmic Optimization:** Traditional optimization (linear programming, genetic algorithms, etc.) is used to _search_ for the best design or policy given a TEA model. It requires an explicit objective function and constraints derived from the technoeconomic model. For instance, if the LCOH as a function of design variables can be calculated, an optimization algorithm will iteratively adjust those variables to minimize LCOH. This approach guarantees finding at least a locally optimal solution and is **model-driven** – its success depends on the fidelity of the TEA model.
- **Comparison:** Machine learning **does not inherently find optima**; rather, it learns mappings from inputs to outputs. On its own, an ML model might predict hydrogen production costs for thousands of technology configurations but would still need an optimizer to find which prediction is minimal. However, ML shines in handling complexity and data. It can uncover nonlinear relationships that are hard to explicitly model and can generalize from limited TEA datapoints. Optimization algorithms, by contrast, require a model; they will dutifully find an optimum of the given cost function, but that optimum is only as accurate as the model. Thus, **ML and optimization are often combined**: ML provides a fast-to-evaluate proxy for simulation results, and an optimization algorithm uses that proxy to search for optimal solutions. This combination is seen in the literature as “surrogate-based optimization” or “machine learning-guided design”​[discovery.ucl.ac.uk](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10176305/1/1-s2.0-S036031992303923X-main.pdf#:~:text=A%20surrogate%20model%20for%20the,model%20is%20published%20to%20facili)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/13/1/268#:~:text=XGBoost%20model%20and%20the%20remaining,to%20verify%20the%20accuracy%20and).
- **Examples and Use-Cases:** In addition to surrogate models, ML is used for **pattern recognition in TEA outputs**. The Notre Dame/NETL study on dynamic hydrogen systems, after performing extensive optimizations, applied multivariate linear regression (an ML technique) to identify which electricity price features most strongly influence the profitability of optimized systems​[pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2024/EE/D4EE02394C#:~:text=technologies%20in%20varying%20energy%20markets,optimal%20technology%20and%20integration%20options). This helped generalize insights from the optimization runs. Another emerging use is **reinforcement learning (RL)**, where an AI “agent” learns control policies (for instance, when to run an electrolyzer or how to load-follow renewables) to maximize a reward (e.g., profit minus CO₂ cost). Hu _et al._ (2023) implemented a deep RL algorithm (TD3) that learned an operational strategy for a polysilicon plant’s renewable hydrogen system, aiming to minimize costs and emissions​[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/13/1/268#:~:text=operating%20conditions%20with%20the%20help,fluctuations%20in%20supply%20and%20demand). The RL agent interacted with a simulated environment (including the XGBoost electrolyzer model) and gradually improved its performance, effectively performing optimization through learning​
