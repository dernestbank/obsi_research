I am going to talk about the most abundant mineral on earth.
Though it may not come in natural deposits in sediments as other benchmack products (white hydrogen).
It has a many applications across different industries and sectors
Hydrogen has high energy content to mass which makes it competitive to other forms of fuels as in natural gas. I has about 3 times more energy/mass content compared to natural gas

This and many factors had led to the predicted global demand of hydrogen

IEA predicts that the global hydrogen demand will soar to a peak of ##### by 2050. This demand will be influence by the ..... applications here The demand of 
Though this prediction is a favorable prediction , several challenges turn to hinder the wide adoption of this economy. Such as political instabilities

But the actual challenge is the high cost of green  hydrogen production
As at the reports recieved by the DoE 2023 cost of hydrogen ranges from 2 to 12. These reported cost vary mainly by the type of hydrogen produce.

There have been several classifications given to different hydrogens production pathways. 
Green blue

These classifications measure the level of sustainability and has a way to qualify a product for incentives as the IRS 45V tax credit.
These and several initiatives and policies around the world has been initiated to reduce the cost of green.

So in the new minutes I am going to be taking you  through some milestone that have been reached and what lies ahead in the next few weeks.
