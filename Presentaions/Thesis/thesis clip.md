Technoeconomic Analysis Methodology 192
(1) selection of system and system boundary; (2) development of process flow diagram;
(3) mass and energy balance analyses; (4) capital cost estimation and (5) oper￾ating and unit production cost estimation


2.2.1 Technological Description and System Boundary
The technological descriptions include plant capacity
and location, understanding of feedstocks and other required raw materials,
brief description of the process, including block flow diagram and informa￾tion on products, byproducts and wastes
Then, system boundary is used to specify the process and products to be investi￾gated. Anything outside the system boundary is known as surrounding.

2.2.2 Process Design 
Data sources
Process flow diagram
Mass and energy balance analyses

Data on the operating parameters include the
amounts of all inputs, their conversion factors, operating conditions (i.e.,
time, temperature and pressure), consumables, products, byproducts and

2.2.3 Economic Analysis
2.2.3.1 Capital Cost Estimation
installation, Contingency Charges, Working Capital I
2.2.3.2 Operating Cost Estimation
2.2.3.2.1 Direct Operating Costs
raw material/ feedstock
utilites
direct and indirect labor
2.2.3.2.2 Indirect Operating Costs
fixed and variable 
property taxes, insurance
and rent will remain the same, and thus are the fixed costs
