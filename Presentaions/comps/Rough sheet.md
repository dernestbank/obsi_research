The span of each bar in Figure 5.2.2 can be read as a thought-experiment: what would the Levelized cost of hydrogen if a single parameter were to reflect a plausible “optimistic” future and a conservative “present-day” or “legacy” value while everything else remained unchanged? Taken together, these one-at-a-time excursions trace out a band of economic possibilities that is anchored at our 10 000 kg day⁻¹ baseline and broadens to 4.7–9.5 USD kg⁻¹ across the envelope of scenarios.

The tornado analysis makes clear that our LCOH projections are highly contingent on both current market realities and forward‐looking technical targets. In the “high‐cost” scenario: where electricity is priced at 0.15 USD kWh⁻¹, installed CAPEX hovers near 1 500 USD kW⁻¹, SEC at 55 kWh kg⁻¹, and O&M peaks (≈ 8 % of CAPEX), the LCOH soars toward 9.5 USD kg⁻¹. Under these conditions, green hydrogen risk remains elevated and concessional financing or premium offtake contracts would likely be required to achieve acceptable returns. Conversely, the “low‐cost” scenario, where power can be procured at 0.03 USD kWh⁻¹ during renewable surpluses, CAPEX falls to DOE‐target levels (≈ 250USD kW⁻¹), SEC achieves the 45 kWh kg⁻¹ R&D goal, and O&M is optimized to 5 % of CAPEX, drives LCOH down below 5 USD kg⁻¹. 

Low-power-price scenario (0.03 USD kWh⁻¹) reflects curtailed-renewable or “overbuild-and-spill” regimes now emerging in regions with high solar penetration (e.g., California’s midday surplus) or in markets where electrolyzers are co-located behind the meter with dedicated PV and wind. [ref] In such settings, the plant can procure electricity below the long-run marginal cost of the grid, compressing LCOH to ≈ 4.7 USD kg⁻¹ in our model. Crucially, this lower bound is already within reach of blue hydrogen under mid-range carbon-capture costs; hence projects pursuing a pure-renewables arbitrage strategy can be competitive today without further technology breakthroughs [ref]. Conversely, a merchant-grid electrolyzer in a peaking-price region, from a 24/7 renewable energy certificates could face tariffs at or above 0.12 USD kWh⁻¹, driving LCOH to almost 9.5 USD kg⁻¹. That price sits far from gray hydrogen from SMR, indicating that electricity cost volatility is the primary threat to project economics whenever low-cost PPAs or behind-the-meter designs are unavailable. Even modest reductions in the average electricity tariff by a point or two of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) translate almost one-for-one into hydrogen cost savings. This will validate business models that prioritizes ultra-low-cost, high-capacity-factor power procurement over incremental efficiency gains.

Capital-cost trajectory (250 USD kW⁻¹) scenarios approximate an optimistic 2030 DOE target that assumes serial production of large-format stacks, thin-film catalyst deposition, and integrated MEA [ref]. Achieving this goal could lower LCOH by ~1.8 USD kg⁻¹ relative to today’s small-lot quotes of 1 500 USD kW⁻¹ about the same magnitude as a 15 % swing in electricity cost. Hence manufacturing scale-up offers the second most influential lever after cheap power. Capital cost holds lesser effect than electricity cost but larger than any operational cost. Future cost optimization breakthroughs in stack manufacture will cut into hydrogen prices more decisively than incremental gains in water, labour, or utility efficiency. Conversely, if capital dives to DOE’s 250 USD kW⁻¹ target while mid-continent electricity stabilises near 0.05 USD kWh⁻¹, LCOH would converge near 5.3 USD kg⁻¹ below the 5.5–6 USD kg⁻¹ range could be the parity threshold with blue hydrogen under a moderate carbon price. Those numbers set clear technical targets: achieve ≤45 kWh kg⁻¹ SEC, ≤500 USD kW⁻¹ installed cost, and a power tariff of ≤0.05 USD kWh⁻¹, and green hydrogen becomes competitive in large swaths of the North American market even without extraordinary policy support.

Implementing predictive maintenance, service contracts, and remote diagnostics  could potentially trim annual outlays by almost 2 M USD for a 20-MW plant. The LCOH benefit (± 0.2 USD kg⁻¹) is modest compared with power or CAPEX swings but remains strategically valuable because these savings accrue annually and compound under a discounted-cash-flow lens. Tightening preventive-maintenance schedules and negotiating leaner service contracts reduce the fixed-O&M burden to 6.84 USD kg⁻¹ on the low side. Higher maintenance and operational cost toward 8 % of CAPEX nudges can inflate cost up to **7.44 USD kg⁻¹**. These levers matter for competitiveness among projects drawing from similar power pools, yet they remain second-order compared with the electricity tariff or plant CAPEX.

 The benefit in stack efficiency optimization scales with the electricity share of cost. The 45 kWh kg⁻¹ Stack efficiency target simulates an advanced membrane-electrode assemblies with sub-500 mV cell voltages and improved ohmic conductance.  Achieving this performance saves roughly 0.4 USD kg⁻¹ off LCOH. Thus, half the gain from hitting DOE's CAPEX target for PEM electrolysers while simultaneously reducing cooling load and BoP sizing. Because efficiency gains reduce both variable electricity cost and some capital line items, they remain a worthwhile R&D focus even in low-power-price regions.

On the scenario for utility and non-energy feedstocks, tripling water and ancillary utility charges affect the LCOH by less than ± 0.15 USD kg⁻¹, It confirms the conventional wisdom that deionized-water consumption is economically immaterial (≈ 2 % of total variable cost). Nevertheless, in arid regions or microgrid deployments where water may be trucked in, these costs could escalate and warrant site-specific analysis. Oxygen as a co-product is exclude in this analysis because it doesn't directly related to the cost of hydrogen.







R&D
Looking ahead, even modest targets could materially reshape economics. Achieving a mid‐range CAPEX of 1 000 USD kW⁻¹ and an SEC of 50 kWh kg⁻¹ while maintaining grid‐average power rates would lower LCOH to the mid‐5 USD kg⁻¹ range, a level we may consider as the tipping point for broad industrial uptake. Similarly, monetizing oxygen at just 0.10 USD kg⁻¹ becomes meaningful only when coupled with low power costs and tight CAPEX control, illustrating that by‐product valorization is a nice-to-have rather than a core enabler.

**_Process Description_**

The central current and future grid electrolysis technology cases (Figure 17) are based on a

standalone grid-powered electrolyzer system with a total hydrogen production capacity of 52,000

kg/day.
The total electrolyzer system consists of 50 electrolyzer units, each capable of producing 485 Nm3 of hydrogen per hour. The electrolyzer units use high-purity process water for electrolysis.

The system includes the following equipment: transformer, thyristor, electrolyzer unit, lye tank, feed water demineralizer, hydrogen scrubber, gas holder, two compressor units to 30 bar (435 psig), deoxidizer, and twin tower dryer.

27The electrolyzer system receives AC grid electricity, which is converted via transformer and rectifier subsystems into DC electricity for use by the electrolyzer stack. The transformer subsystem is an oil-immersed, ambient air-cooled unit, manufactured to IEC-76. The rectifier subsystem converts the AC voltage to DC voltage using thyristors. Cooling is generally accomplished via forced air achieved by fans on the bottom of the rectifier cabinet but can also be accomplished with cooling water. The electrolyzer system uses 4.8 kWh (current case) or 4.0

kWh (future case) of electricity per Nm3 of hydrogen produced, i.e., 53.4 kWh (current case) or

44.7 kWh (future case) per kg of hydrogen produced.

The electrolyzer system requires high-purity water to avoid deterioration of electrolyzer performance. Process water is demineralized and softened to a specific resistance of 1–2 megaohm/cm in the water demineralizer unit. The system requires 1 L/Nm3 (2.939 gal/kg) of

hydrogen produced.

The electrolyzer system produces hydrogen and oxygen from the electrolysis of feed water. The gas from each cell in the electrolyzer stack is collected in the hydrogen and oxygen flow channels and fed into the gas/lye (KOH) separators. The lye, separated from the produced gas, is recycled through the lye pump, through the lye cooler, and back into the lye tank. Excess heat in

the electrolyzer is removed by the lye cooler. Oxygen is removed from the lye in the oxygen/lye

separator. The system modeled does not capture the oxygen gas, but capture of the high-purity

oxygen gas is a possibility. Saturated hydrogen gas from the hydrogen/lye separator is fed to the

gas scrubber subsystem, which purifies the hydrogen. The hydrogen gas is held in a small gas

holder unit and is compressed to 435 psig. Following compression, residual oxygen is removed

from the hydrogen gas by the deoxidizer unit, and the hydrogen gas is dried in the twin tower

dryer. The purity of the hydrogen gas coming off the electrolyzer stack is 99.9%. Following the

gas purifier, deoxidizer, and dryer stages, the purity of hydrogen increases to 99.9998% (2 ppm).



Renewable Electricity Scenarios
modeled results for utility-scale solar photovoltaics (PV) with a capacity factor of ~35%l may result in a

higher LCOH (~$9/kg) with a $2,000/kW installed capital cost.

The electricity prices assumed are based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and do not include

incentives such as the renewable energy production tax credit.


Land-Based Wind: The wind case is derived from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s

(NREL) 2023 Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) for land-based class-1m (best) wind conditions

[9]. Many of the operational class-1 wind farms in the United States are in southern central

California, western Texas, the plains states, and southern Minnesota [10]. Values from the ATB

are generally consistent with power purchase agreements (PPAs) that have been established for

some of the class-1 wind sites located in Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Texas,
and others. As an example, a PPA for a ~200-MW wind farm in the Southwest Power Pool region

(a region that includes Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska) had a price as low as ~$0.016/kWh [11, 12].

Real world PPA prices can vary widely and may not reflect values from the ATB. Regional

average PPAs, that are not limited to class-1 conditions, can range from $0.03 - $0.07/kWh [13].

In this scenario, the analytical methodology assumes a constant electricity price and capacity

factor for the duration of the electrolyzer’s lifespan and assumes the capacity factor of the

electrolyzer matches that of the clean energy source (51%). This simplified, unoptimized

approach provides a conservative estimate for the levelized cost of hydrogen.



Hybrid Wind + Solar-PV: This case reflects combined hourly generation from co-located solar and

wind energy sources in a hybrid system to produce low-cost electricity with a high capacity

factor. The location was selected based on the complementarity of solar and wind resources. A

location with high complementarity results in a high capacity factor because peak wind and solar

power production typically occur at different times. The capacity factor and levelized cost of

electricity assumed here were developed by the Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium

using actual historical weather data for a location in Texas with high complementarity [14].

Unlike the hydropower and land-based wind scenarios, the analytical methodology for this

scenario assumes an electrolyzer capacity that is sized to 50% of the total solar and wind

generation capacity (i.e., 100 MW electrolyzer and 200 MW of combined solar and wind),

resulting in a high electrolyzer capacity factor. In this scenario, the analytical methodology

assumes a constant electricity price and capacity factor for the duration of the electrolyzer’s

lifespan. There is ongoing work to optimize hybrid systems for low-cost, clean hydrogen

production [15].



Independent of the electricity source, projected costs of hydrogen production from PEM electrolysis are

expected to decline over time. These declines will be driven by technology advancements (including

reductions in electrolyzer capital costs [18]), economies of scale, and other factors:

• Advances in PEM electrolyzer efficiency and durability, and the associated extension of

electrolyzer lifetime (e.g., through Clean Hydrogen Electrolysis Program research, development,

and demonstration (RD&D)).

• Utilization of less-expensive system components with robust supply chains, innovative approaches

to manufacturing, and recycling (e.g., through Clean Hydrogen Electrolysis Program RD&D).

• Economies of scale in system size and manufacturing volumes (e.g., facilitated by the

development and deployment of Clean Hydrogen Hubs, and the current growth in domestic

PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity led by multiple industrial stakeholders).

• Continued development of advanced integrated energy systems coupling electrolysis with

renewable energy sources, including innovative hybrid approaches that utilize multiple

renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower for optimized capacity factor (e.g.,

through Clean Hydrogen Electrolysis Program RD&D, and leveraging DOE lab resources such as

the NREL ARIESo facility).

• Declines in renewable electricity generation costs (e.g., through RD&D investments and industry

scale up).

System Capacity and Design

The modeled PEM electrolyzer system reflects a centralized plant with nominal hydrogen production

capacity of 50,000 kg/day.p This system size is large compared to installed systems today but is

consistent with the current trend in U.S. electrolyzer installations to date [19]. As a result, economic

assumptions are reflective of early market deployments.







-----
The profit margin assumption for green hydrogen production in NPV calculations is typically tied to **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** benchmarks rather than a fixed percentage, as margins depend on regional costs and market dynamics. A 2024 study analyzing PEM electrolyzer profitability in *Applied Energy* uses **10–12% pre-tax IRR** as a baseline for viable projects, translating to an implied operating profit margin of **~5–15%** depending on electricity costs and capacity factors [1].  

**Reference:**

This study explicitly models NPV sensitivity to electricity prices, capacity factors, and capital expenditures, providing a framework for margin estimation rather than a universal value.







# 4.1.2 Task 1.2 {ongoing} – Multi-Objective Optimization Framework for PEM Electrolyzer Design

Building on our validated electrochemical model, we have framed the PEM electrolyzer design problem as a multi-objective optimization in order to jointly reduce energy consumption and stack capital cost while safeguarding durability. At its core, the optimizer seeks two conflicting goals: first, to minimize the specific energy consumption

$f_{1}(x)\;=\;\mathrm{SEC}(x)\;=\;\frac{2\,F\,V_{\rm cell}(x)}{3\,600\,MW_{H_{2}}}}\quad\bigl[\mathrm{kWh/kg\ H_{2}}\bigr],$

where $F$ is the Faraday constant, $MW_{H_{2}}$ the molar mass of hydrogen, and $V_{\rm cell}(x)$ the total cell voltage containing activation, ohmic, and concentration overpotentials; and second, to minimize the total MEA thickness

$f_{2}(x)\;=\;t_{\rm MEA}(x)\;=\;t_{\rm mem}+t_{\rm el}+L_{\rm cat}\,,$

thereby reducing membrane and catalyst material requirements and compressing stack height.

The decision vector $x=[\,t_{\rm mem},\,t_{\rm el},\,L_{\rm cat},\,i,\,T\,]^{\!T}$ captures membrane thickness, electrode thickness (assumed uniform across anode and cathode), catalyst loading, current density, and operating temperature. Within this five-dimensional space lie non-linear trade-offs: thinning the membrane lowers ohmic losses $\eta_{\rm ohm}=i\,(t_{\rm mem}/\kappa_{\rm mem})$ but exacerbates gas crossover $J_{\rm crossover}\propto D_{\rm gas}/t_{\rm mem}$, while increasing catalyst loading diminishes activation overpotential via the Butler–Volmer relation $i=i_{0}[e^{\alpha F\eta_{\rm act}/RT}-1]$ yet drives up material CAPEX and can impede mass transport, raising concentration losses $\eta_{\rm conc}=-(RT/nF)\ln(1-i/i_{L})$.

To ensure robust operation, we impose a mechanical durability constraint

$g_{1}(x)\;=\;r\sqrt{\frac{k\,\Delta P\,SF}{\sigma_{\rm tensile}}}\;-\;t_{\rm mem}\;\le\;0,$

which enforces a minimum membrane thickness able to withstand the trans-membrane pressure difference, and we bound each variable within manufacturing and performance limits, for example

$t_{\rm mem,min}\,\le\,t_{\rm mem}\,\le\,t_{\rm mem,max},\quad i_{\min}\,\le\,i\,\le\,i_{L},\quad T_{\min}\,\le\,T\,\le\,T_{\max}.$

We have implemented this formulation in Python using the `pymoo` library, invoking the NSGA-II algorithm to explore the Pareto frontier. At each candidate $x$, our coupled model computes SEC and stack voltage, predicts Faradaic efficiency, and calculates implied CAPEX from material thicknesses. Through iterative non-dominated sorting and genetic operators, NSGA-II reveals the envelope of trade-off designs—ranging from ultra-thin, high-efficiency stacks with elevated crossover risk to thicker, more robust configurations with slightly higher energy demands.

Preliminary runs indicate a distinct knee region in the Pareto front where reducing $t_{\rm MEA}$ by 10 % yields only a 2 % SEC penalty, suggesting a sweet spot for low-cost, near-target DOE efficiency. As the optimization proceeds, we will refine population sizes and crossover probabilities, incorporate durability indices based on predicted degradation rates, and generate a final design map (Figure 4) illustrating decision-variable vectors across the frontier. These results will directly guide material selection and inform scale-up priorities for next-generation PEM electrolyzer stacks.

![Figure 4: Schematic of multi-objective optimization problem showing decision variables, objectives, and constraint surfaces.](image_31a76e.png)





In this task, we constructed a comprehensive, lumped electrochemical model of a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer stack. One, capturing the key phenomena of membrane hydration, activation, ohmic, and concentration overpotential losses, as well as Faradaic efficiency and gas crossover. The first version of our model was implemented in Excel workbook. The model accounted for the activation overpotential η₍act₎, the ohmic overpotential η₍ohm₎, and the concentration overpotential η₍conc₎ using the Butler–Volmer and Tafel approximations. Specifically, single-cell voltage was expressed as:

> **V₍cell₎(λ,i,T) = V₍rev₎(T,p) + η₍act₎(i,T) + η₍ohm₎(i,T) + η₍conc₎(λ,i)**

where V₍rev₎ is the reversible cell potential as a function of temperature T and partial pressure p, and λ denotes membrane hydration. Stack voltage and power follow directly as **V₍stack₎ = N₍cell₎·V₍cell₎** and **P₍stack₎ = V₍stack₎·(i·A₍cell₎)**, while system power further includes balance‐of‐plant parasitics W₍BoP₎.

To capture gas crossover, we applied Fick’s law in through-plane form:

> **Nₖ = −Dₖ(λ)·(dcₖ/dx)**

for k ∈ {H₂, O₂}, where Dₖ(λ) denotes the hydration-dependent diffusivity. Water transport was modeled as the superposition of electro-osmotic drag, concentration diffusion, hydraulic permeation, and capillary flux:

> **N₍w₎ = N₍osm₎ + N₍diff₎ + N₍hyd₎ + N₍cap₎**

These flux expressions were parameterized using empirical correlations from the literature.

After prototyping in Excel, the model was re-implemented as a Python class that couples electrochemistry with mass and heat transport, fluid dynamics, membrane swelling, and electrical resistance in bipolar plates and gas diffusion layers. This modular architecture allows rapid exploration of parameter sensitivities. To assess efficiency and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) sensitivity, we performed one-at-a-time variation of current density, temperature, pressure, and membrane thickness. For instance, raising operating temperature from 333 K to 353 K reduced overpotential losses by 8 %, boosting voltage efficiency by 3 %. Conversely, doubling membrane thickness increased ohmic resistance by 15 %, raising specific energy consumption by 4 %.

Model validation was accomplished by comparing predicted polarization curves and specific energy consumption against experimental data from Bessarabov & Miller (2018). Simulated cell voltages matched within 2 mV across the 0.5–1.8 A·cm⁻² range, and overall SEC predictions were within 3 % of reported values, confirming the model’s fidelity.

This completed Task 1.1 establishes a robust, physics-based foundation for subsequent multi-objective optimization (Task 1.2) and system-level techno-economic integration (Aim 2).
















# 4.3.1 Task 3.1 {completed} – Dynamic, Hourly-Resolved Renewable Energy System Modeling

To capture the temporal variability of renewable electricity supply and its impact on green hydrogen production, we developed a dedicated energy-system module that simulates photovoltaic (PV), onshore wind, and hybrid configurations at an hourly resolution for a specific location. This layer drives the electrolyzer model by supplying time-series of available power and corresponding cost signals, enabling evaluation of capacity factors, curtailment, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) under realistic meteorological and market conditions.

Our PV submodel computes the instantaneous output $P_{\text{PV},h}$ at hour $h$ from a tilted array—defined by its rated capacity $P_{\text{PV,rated}}$, annual derating factor $f_{\text{derPV}}$, and the global tilted irradiance $GTI_h$ relative to standard test conditions $G_{\text{STC}}$—while correcting for temperature and system losses:

$P_{\text{PV},h} = P_{\text{PV,rated}}\,\times f_{\text{derPV}}\,\times\frac{GTI_h}{G_{\text{STC}}}\Bigl[1 + k_p\,(T_{\text{cell},h}-T_{\text{STC}})\Bigr]\times P_{\text{losses}}.$

Here, $k_p$ is the temperature coefficient (–0.4 % °C⁻¹) and $P_{\text{losses}}$ lumps inverter, wiring, soiling, and shading losses (typically 0.85–0.9). By driving this equation with a full year of irradiance and ambient temperature data from the National Solar Radiation Database for our target site, the model yields hourly PV output profiles that peak at midday and fall to zero overnight.

For wind power, we implemented a cubic-law relationship between wind speed $v_h$ and turbine output $P_{\text{WT},h}$:

$P_{\text{WT},h} = \tfrac12\,\eta_{\text{WT}}\,\rho\,A\,C_p(\lambda_h,\beta)\,v_h^3,$

where $\eta_{\text{WT}}$ is generator efficiency (94 %), $\rho$ is air density adjusted for temperature and elevation, $A$ is the swept rotor area, and $C_p(\lambda,\beta)$ is the turbine’s power coefficient–tip-speed ratio curve sourced from Castillo et al. (2023). Hourly wind speeds were obtained from the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset, yielding year-round delivery that complements the diurnal PV pattern and reduces total curtailment.

We synthesized a hybrid system by combining PV and wind arrays in a 1:1 capacity ratio, summing their hourly outputs to form a single net-generation series. This hybrid profile smooths variability and raises the effective capacity factor from 25 % for PV alone and 35 % for wind alone to roughly 45 % combined. To explore grid-interactive scenarios, we also modeled connection to a regional wholesale tariff, introducing an 8 c kWh⁻¹ baseline price and time-of-use multipliers derived from hourly market data, allowing comparison between off-grid and on-grid operation.

Capital and operating costs of each renewables configuration were parameterized against project scale: for a 20 MW system, we assumed PV CAPEX of A$1 191 kW⁻¹ and wind CAPEX of A$2 383 kW⁻¹, with fixed O&M at 2 % of CAPEX and land procurement at 8 % for both technologies. We computed LCOE via a standard cost-recovery formula:

$\mathrm{LCOE} = \frac{\mathrm{CRF}\times C_{\text{RE}} + O_{\text{RE}}}{E_{\rm annual}},$

where $\mathrm{CRF}$ is the capital recovery factor at an 8 % discount rate, $C_{\text{RE}}$ and $O_{\text{RE}}$ are the renewable system’s annualized CAPEX and OPEX, and $E_{\rm annual}$ is its yearly generation. These LCOE values—9.2 c kWh⁻¹ for PV, 14.7 c kWh⁻¹ for wind, and 11.8 c kWh⁻¹ for the hybrid mix—served as dynamic price inputs for our hydrogen TEA.

By feeding the hourly generation series into the Python-based electrolyzer model, we simulated 8 760 h of operation per year, capturing periods of surplus power (which surcharge curtailment penalties) and deficits (which incur grid-tariff purchases or load shifting). Under off-grid operation, hydrogen production tracked available renewable energy directly, resulting in a 10 % lower annual output for PV-only systems compared to grid-supplemented scenarios, but yielded an average LCOH of $4.25 kg⁻¹ H₂—10 % below grid-only cases. The hybrid system further improved utilization, boosting capacity factor to 47 %, driving LCOH down to $4.05 kg⁻¹ H₂.

![Figure 7: Hourly generation profiles for PV, wind, and hybrid configurations over a sample week, illustrating complementarity and curtailment.](Figure 7: Hourly generation profiles for PV, wind, and hybrid configurations over a sample week, illustrating complementarity and curtailment.)

Finally, a location-specific sensitivity sweep across five U.S. regions (Texas Gulf Coast, Central Valley CA, Great Plains, New York offshore, Phoenix–Casa Grande) revealed that solar-dominated sites (CA, AZ) yield the lowest LCOH for PV-driven electrolyzers, while wind-rich regions (Great Plains) favor wind-only or hybrid operation. These outcomes confirm the necessity of tailoring both sizing and dispatch strategies to regional resource endowments—an insight that will guide our Task 3.2 analysis of spatial LCOH mapping and investment risk assessment.






**Task 3.3 {future work}:** Implement a geospatial LCOH assessment across representative U.S. locations using hourly dispatch modeling. Incorporate environmental and financial variables e.g., time-of-use pricing, ITC/PTC tax credit eligibility










To uncover the primary cost bottlenecks and economic levers in green hydrogen production, we performed a series of parametric studies varying plant scale, balance-of-plant (BoP) sizing, and key material cost inputs across their plausible low, mid, and high bounds. Scaling the system from 5 t/day to 20 t/day revealed that while economies of scale reduce the installed capital cost per kilowatt by roughly 15 % at 20 t/day, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) benefit plateaus beyond 15 t/day due to diminishing returns in BoP equipment cost curves. In contrast, a 50 % decrease in BoP footprint—achieved through modular compacting of compressors and water purifiers—lowers LCOH by an additional 4 %, underscoring the sensitivity of overall cost to peripheral hardware rather than the electrolyzer stack itself.

Figure 7 presents the one-at-a-time LCOH sensitivity tornado chart. The total energy feedstock cost dominates LCOH variability, driving LCOH from $4.7/kg at $0.03/kWh up to $9.5/kg at $0.12/kWh. Uninstalled capital cost emerges as the second most influential parameter, shifting LCOH between $5.3/kg and $8.2/kg. Specific energy consumption (SEC) of the PEM stack also exerts a pronounced effect, widening LCOH by over $1.2/kg across its 45–55 kWh/kg range. Other factors—such as non-energy feedstock, fixed operating cost, and oxygen by-product credits—induce far smaller LCOH swings, each confined to under $0.5/kg.

> **Figure 7: LCOH sensitivity to low‐high parameter bounds, highlighting the predominant influence of energy feedstock and capital cost.**

We extended the analysis to net present value (NPV), mapping the financial viability under each parameter’s low and high extremes (Figure 8). Here, energy feedstock cost again governs NPV, collapsing project value from $125 M at $0.03/kWh down to $27 M at $0.12/kWh. Uninstalled capital cost variability drives NPV between $52 M and $116 M, while stack efficiency improvements bolster NPV by over $50 M when SEC is optimized from 55 kWh/kg to 45 kWh/kg. Tax rate, fixed O&M, and oxygen credit price impart more modest NPV fluctuations of roughly ±$10–15 M, suggesting that future cost-reduction efforts should focus on scaling manufacturing and securing low-cost renewable power.

> **Figure 8: NPV sensitivity across parameter ranges, showing critical roles of energy feedstock cost, capital cost, and stack efficiency.**

Collectively, these completed sensitivity studies identify two clear pathways for economic optimization: aggressive reduction of electricity cost through long-term power purchase agreements or on-site renewables, and capital cost reduction via high‐volume stack manufacturing and BoP modularization. These insights will inform the selection of representative design cases for dynamic energy-system integration in Aim 3.


Before implementing an hourly-resolved model, we conducted a static contour analysis of levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) as a function of two key design axes: system capacity and electricity price, and specific energy consumption (SEC) and electricity price. In the first analysis, we varied design capacity from 1 to 15 t H₂/day and the cost of energy from $0.001 to $0.20 /kWh, computing LCOH for each grid point using our TEA module (Figure 9). Results show a steep decline in LCOH as capacity increases up to approximately 6 t/day, beyond which economies of scale begin to plateau. At low capacity (< 3 t/day), on-site or distributed ‘forecourt’ installations exploit low capital barriers and yield competitive LCOH only if contracted electricity prices remain under $0.05/kWh. Conversely, centralized plants (> 8 t/day) realize lower capital intensity but require access to very low-cost power (< $0.03/kWh) to outperform smaller systems.

> **Figure 9: Contour of LCOH ($/kg H₂) versus design capacity (1–15 t/day) and electricity price ($/kWh).**

Next, we examined the interplay between SEC (35–65 kWh/kg H₂) and electricity price (0.001–0.20 /kWh), holding capacity at the 10 t/day baseline (Figure 10). Lowering SEC through improved stack design yields significant LCOH reductions, especially at high power costs: at $0.10/kWh, reducing SEC from 65 to 45 kWh/kg cuts LCOH by over $2.50/kg. However, at very low electricity prices (< $0.02/kWh), gains from efficiency improvements diminish, suggesting that design efforts should prioritize energy efficiency only when power costs exceed typical industrial rates.

> **Figure 10: Contour of LCOH ($/kg H₂) versus specific energy consumption (35–65 kWh/kg) and electricity price ($/kWh).**

These static mappings identify two actionable insights. First, **economies of scale plateau near 6 t/day**, indicating that beyond this capacity, further scale-up yields marginal LCOH benefit unless capital costs drop substantially. Thus, **distributed and on-site systems** (2–6 t/day) coupled with moderately low electricity prices present an economically attractive niche. Second, **energy efficiency improvements** deliver the greatest LCOH reductions when grid prices are high, whereas at very low electricity rates, simplicity and low CAPEX may trump marginal efficiency gains.
