### 3.1 PEM Design, Tradeoffs, and Multi-Objective Optimization Background

Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are a leading technology for green hydrogen production due to their compact design and high performance. They can operate at high current densities and produce very pure hydrogen with high efficiency. @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 
However, these advantages come with significant trade-offs. PEM systems rely on expensive noble-metal catalysts (typically Pt at the cathode and IrO₂ at the anode) and costly materials like titanium bipolar plates and perfluorinated membranes (e.g. Nafion) @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 . These material requirements drive up capital costs and have historically limited widespread adoption @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 . Moreover, PEM components are sensitive and can degrade under operating stresses; studies have noted issues with membrane durability, gas diffusion layer (GDL) stability, and overall component lifetimes @tanerTechnoeconomicAnalysisMore2019 . In short, PEM electrolyzer design involves balancing performance against cost and longevity – improving one aspect often compromises another.

Recent research has focused on addressing these trade-offs through advanced materials and design optimization. Steady progress has been made in developing improved membranes, catalysts, and other cell components to enhance performance while driving down costs  @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 . For example, thinner membranes and higher catalyst loadings can boost efficiency and output, but they may reduce durability or use more scarce materials. Conversely, efforts to reduce precious metal content and use cheaper membranes aim to cut costs, though often at some penalty to performance or requiring new innovations to maintain efficiency. Degradation mechanisms – such as catalyst dissolution, membrane chemical breakdown, and corrosion of bipolar plates – have been the subject of intensive study @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022  . Understanding these failure modes under real operating conditions is crucial, as improved durability directly impacts lifecycle cost. This remains a gap in many models: traditionally, design optimizations emphasize initial performance (efficiency, hydrogen output, etc.) without fully accounting for long-term degradation. As a result, a key research need is to integrate durability considerations into PEM electrolyzer design optimization to ensure that performance gains are sustainable over the system’s lifetime  @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 .

To systematically navigate these complex trade-offs, multi-objective optimization techniques are increasingly employed. In a multi-objective framework, designers can simultaneously consider multiple goals – for instance, maximizing efficiency and hydrogen production rate while minimizing cost and pressure drop – rather than optimizing a single metric. This approach yields a Pareto frontier of “best trade-off” designs. A number of studies have applied evolutionary algorithms (such as the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, NSGA-II) to explore such trade-offs in hydrogen systems @seyamMultiobjectiveOptimizationHydrogen2019 . For example, Chen _et al._ (2024) developed a detailed multi-physics model of a PEM electrolyzer cell and used it with a neural-network surrogate to perform multi-objective optimization of the cell’s structural and operating parameters @chenMultiobjectiveOptimizationDesign2024 . They optimized variables including flow rate, channel dimensions, and operating temperature, targeting improved performance (higher current density and hydrogen output) while maintaining uniform temperature distribution and manageable pressure drops @chenMultiobjectiveOptimizationDesign2024 . The optimal design identified by Chen _et al._ increased peak current density by ~16% and reduced oxygen build-up in the catalyst layer by ~41% relative to the baseline, all while keeping pressure losses reasonable@chenMultiobjectiveOptimizationDesign2024 . Notably, their results highlighted that enhancing mass and heat transfer (by raising temperature and altering flow channels) can significantly boost performance, but only up to a point – further improvements face diminishing returns due to the counteracting increase in pressure drop @chenMultiobjectiveOptimizationDesign2024 . This exemplifies how multi-objective optimization can pinpoint a balanced design: in this case achieving a trade-off between efficiency and fluidic losses that yields better overall performance than the original design.


Multi-objective approaches have also been extended to broader system contexts involving PEM electrolyzers. Seyam _et al._ (2019), for instance, optimized a hybrid renewable energy system (solar PV + wind turbines + a PEM electrolyzer, with a cooling subsystem) using NSGA-II @seyamMultiobjectiveOptimizationHydrogen2019 . They considered multiple objectives simultaneously – including the system’s energy and exergy efficiencies, total hydrogen production, cooling output, and cost/environmental impact – and obtained a Pareto set of optimal solutions @seyamMultiobjectiveOptimizationHydrogen2019. Such studies demonstrate the power of multi-objective optimization in revealing design trade-offs: one can identify solutions that, say, sacrifice a bit of hydrogen output in exchange for markedly lower cost or higher efficiency, depending on stakeholder priorities  @seyamMultiobjectiveOptimizationHydrogen2019 . A consistent finding is that no single design maximizes all objectives; instead, engineers must decide on acceptable trade-offs. The literature provides tools like Pareto front visualization and decision-making criteria to aid in selecting among the Pareto-optimal alternatives @seyamMultiobjectiveOptimizationHydrogen2019 . Overall, multi-objective optimization has become a valuable methodology in the PEM electrolyzer field to rigorously evaluate design trade-offs and drive innovation. Still, challenges remain in practice – notably, ensuring that the models underpinning these optimizations (electrochemical, thermal, and even cost models) accurately capture real-world behavior, including dynamic operation and degradation over time. These factors, often simplified or ignored in optimization studies, represent important gaps for future research to address  @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 , @hernandez-gomezCellVoltageStaticdynamic2021.

## 3.2 Techno-Economic Modeling Background

Techno-economic modeling provides a complementary perspective by focusing on the costs, economic viability, and scale-up implications of hydrogen production systems. A typical techno-economic analysis (TEA) for a hydrogen electrolyzer project will estimate capital expenditures (CAPEX), operating expenditures (OPEX), and the resulting levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) – essentially the break-even price of hydrogen needed for a given return on investment @yukeshkannahTechnoeconomicAssessmentVarious2021  . Tools such as the U.S. Department of Energy’s H2A model implement a discounted cash-flow approach to compute hydrogen production costs on a consistent basis @colletTechnoeconomicLifeCycle2017  . Key inputs include the electrolyzer system cost (often normalized per kW of capacity), stack lifetime and replacement schedule, efficiency (which determines electricity use), electricity price, capacity factor (operating hours per year), and other expenses like maintenance, labor, and feedstock water @yukeshkannahTechnoeconomicAssessmentVarious2021 . Because hydrogen production via electrolysis is electricity-intensive, the cost of electricity and the utilization rate of the electrolyzer are usually the dominant factors in the economics @yukeshkannahTechnoeconomicAssessmentVarious2021 . High-level analyses indicate that electricity alone often contributes on the order of 50% (or more) of the hydrogen cost @yukeshkannahTechnoeconomicAssessmentVarious2021 . For instance, one review noted that for water electrolysis, “40–50% electricity costs account for more than 50% of H₂ costs,” underscoring how critical low-cost power is to economical hydrogen @yukeshkannahTechnoeconomicAssessmentVarious2021 . Similarly, because the capital cost of electrolyzers is significant, running the equipment at a high capacity factor is vital to amortize that investment. Operating for only a few hundred hours a year (as might happen if tied to a small or intermittent energy source without storage) will lead to a very high cost per kilogram of hydrogen; studies suggest at least 3,000–6,000 full-load hours per year are needed for favorable economics @yukeshkannahTechnoeconomicAssessmentVarious2021 .

Recent techno-economic studies have quantified the current cost landscape for green hydrogen and explored pathways to reduce costs. Jang _et al._ (2022) performed a TEA comparing several water electrolysis technologies (alkaline, PEM, and two solid-oxide scenarios) under renewable energy inputs @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 . They found that, at present, alkaline electrolyzers tend to have a cost advantage over PEM: in their analysis, alkaline electrolysis yielded hydrogen at an estimated $7.60/kg, versus about $8.55/kg for PEM, assuming similar scale and renewable electricity supply @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022  . (Solid-oxide electrolysis, if it can utilize waste heat from an external source, showed even lower costs around $7.16/kg in that study @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 .) The higher cost for PEM is partly due to its higher capital cost and replacement costs, as well as slightly lower electrical efficiency relative to a mature alkaline system @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 . However, the gap is expected to narrow and even reverse with continued technology development. A detailed bottom-up cost projection by Yang _et al._ (2023) compared alkaline (ALK), anion exchange membrane (AEM), and PEM electrolyzers in current and future scenarios  @yangEconomicAnalysisHydrogen2023  . Their model incorporated technical performance parameters (like each system’s polarization curve, catalyst loadings, membrane characteristics, etc.) into the cost calculation, linking improvements in efficiency and durability directly to economic outcomes @yangEconomicAnalysisHydrogen2023  . Yang _et al._ report that today ALK electrolyzers produce the cheapest hydrogen (on the order of 24%–52% cheaper than AEM or PEM in the short term), but with anticipated advances, AEM and PEM could become competitive or superior. In fact, they predict PEM electrolyzer hydrogen could become ~56% cheaper than alkaline in the long term (e.g. by 2050) if technical targets are met @yangEconomicAnalysisHydrogen2023   . A crucial factor in these projections is the **lifetime** of the electrolyzer stacks – longer lifetimes dramatically improve the economics by spreading capital costs over more hydrogen output. Yang _et al._ emphasize that electrolyzer lifespan is “significantly vital” to hydrogen cost: if PEM systems can achieve major gains in durability (and thus reduce the frequency of stack replacements), their cost per kg drops substantially @yangEconomicAnalysisHydrogen2023 . This illustrates the interplay between engineering improvements and economics, and it identifies extended durability as a key R&D lever for cost reduction.

Besides deterministic cost estimates, contemporary techno-economic modeling often employs sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to capture the range of possible outcomes and to identify key cost drivers. Sensitivity analysis in TEA involves varying input parameters (capital cost, electricity price, efficiency, capacity factor, financing terms, etc.) to see how much they affect the final LCOH. Jang _et al._ (2022) performed such an analysis and confirmed that capital cost reduction, lower electricity prices (or incentives like electricity tax exemptions), and favorable financing can markedly improve the competitiveness of green hydrogen @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 [Box]. They found that capital cost is one of the most influential factors; hence strategies like manufacturing scale-up and technological innovation to cut electrolyzer costs are critical, alongside securing low-cost renewable electricity @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 . In addition, Jang _et al._ used a Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainties in their economic evaluation @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 . By assigning probability distributions to uncertain inputs (for example, future electricity prices or stack replacement costs), they ran many simulations to produce a distribution of possible hydrogen costs. This approach helps estimate risk and confidence intervals – for example, the probability that hydrogen cost will fall below a certain threshold. Similarly, Yates _et al._ (2020) incorporated uncertainty analysis in their TEA of an off-grid solar-PV powered electrolyzer system @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . Their Monte Carlo framework explored a wide range of input assumptions (solar output variability, component costs, etc.) to pinpoint what combinations of conditions would be required to achieve competitive hydrogen costs  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . Such techniques represent a methodological development in techno-economic modeling, moving beyond point estimates to a more robust understanding of economic feasibility under real-world variability and future unknowns.

Another important aspect of techno-economic models is integrating them with renewable energy and grid models to capture operational dynamics. Traditional TEA often assumes a certain capacity factor and average electricity price, but in practice, these are tied to when and how the electrolyzer is operated (e.g., only when surplus power is available). To address this, some studies couple techno-economic calculations with time-series simulation or optimization of energy systems. Yates _et al._ (2020) is a clear example: they modeled a stand-alone PV-electrolyzer system using historical solar irradiance data for various locations and optimized the sizing of the PV array relative to the electrolyzer capacity @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . By doing so, they identified site-specific strategies – for instance, in very sunny locations, a smaller PV array per electrolyzer may suffice, whereas in less sunny areas a larger PV capacity is needed to reach a target hydrogen output at low cost @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . Their analysis highlighted “keys to competitiveness” for off-grid hydrogen such as access to high solar resource, reductions in PV and electrolyzer costs, and scaling up system size to achieve economies of scale @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . This kind of integrated modeling is becoming more common as researchers recognize that the economics of hydrogen are tightly linked to the characteristics of the energy sources and operation profiles. Indeed, the variability of renewables poses a challenge to simple economics – an electrolyzer subject to intermittent operation may have higher unit costs – but advanced modeling can quantify this impact and guide design choices (like adding energy storage or oversizing generation) to mitigate it. In summary, techno-economic modeling of hydrogen production has evolved to incorporate not just static cost estimates but also dynamic operation considerations, risk analysis, and future scenarios. The consensus of recent literature is that green hydrogen costs, while currently higher than fossil-derived hydrogen, are on a promising downward trajectory. Aggressive targets are driving this field; for example, the U.S. Department of Energy’s “Hydrogen Shot” initiative aims for $1 per kg hydrogen by 2030 (an 80% cost reduction) @HydrogenShot; @doeHydrogenShot2020 . Achieving such goals will likely require simultaneous progress in electrolyzer technology (to cut CAPEX and improve efficiency/lifetime) and in the deployment of abundant, low-cost renewable power – factors that techno-economic models continue to analyze and refine @HydrogenShot; @doeHydrogenShot2020.


## 3.3 Renewable Energy System Background

Hydrogen’s role in the context of renewable energy systems has grown out of the need to address the intermittency and mismatch of supply and demand inherent to sources like wind and solar. As the penetration of renewable electricity increases worldwide, there is a pressing requirement for energy storage and sector coupling solutions to ensure reliability and fully utilize renewable generation @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 . Converting surplus renewable electricity into hydrogen via PEM electrolyzers is a promising strategy to buffer this intermittency. The hydrogen can be stored and later converted back to electricity (through fuel cells or turbines) or used as a fuel/feedstock in other sectors, effectively allowing excess solar or wind power to be time-shifted and used when needed @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . One key advantage of hydrogen in this role is its scalability and portability: unlike batteries, which are suitable for short-duration storage, hydrogen can economically store energy over long periods (even seasonally) and can be transported or distributed through pipelines, potentially utilizing existing gas infrastructure @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . Jang _et al._ (2022) note that among various energy storage methods being explored (pumped hydro, batteries, compressed air, etc.), power-to-gas hydrogen stands out for its large-scale and long-term storage capability, which is crucial for balancing a grid dominated by weather-dependent generators @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 . In short, renewable-centric energy systems increasingly view green hydrogen as a flexible energy carrier that complements direct electrification.

Implementing hydrogen in renewable energy systems can take several forms. One common concept is co-locating electrolyzers with renewable generation facilities (such as a wind farm or solar PV park) to directly convert onsite power to hydrogen. This approach can avoid curtailment of renewables during periods of excess supply and can reduce the need for grid expansion. The U.S. DOE has highlighted this synergy: instead of curtailing wind farm output during off-peak times, that electricity can produce hydrogen which in turn adds value and provides fuel for other uses[energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-electrolysis#:~:text=dynamic%20and%20intermittent%20power%20generation%2C,to%20produce%20hydrogen%20through%20electrolysis). By integrating electrolysis with renewable plants, operators gain operational flexibility – they can decide whether to send power to the grid or to hydrogen production based on market conditions and resource availability @doeHydrogenShot2020  [energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-electrolysis#:~:text=Potential%20for%20synergy%20with%20renewable,from%20wind%20farms%2C%20instead%20of). This flexibility can help stabilize grids (acting as a controllable load) and also create an additional revenue stream for renewable project developers. Off-grid or stand-alone renewable hydrogen systems push this idea to an extreme: Yates _et al._ (2020) studied an off-grid PV-powered electrolyzer configuration for remote locations, finding that such a system can deliver competitively priced hydrogen if certain conditions are met @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020. Chief among those conditions are a low capital cost for PV and electrolyzer components, a high-quality solar resource, and a sufficiently large scale to approach economies of scale @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . Their results indicated that sunny, remote regions (with cheap land and high solar irradiance) could produce hydrogen at costs approaching conventional fuels, especially as technology costs continue to decline  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . This suggests there may be specific niches (such as deserts or other high-renewable areas) where green hydrogen production can be particularly advantageous even off the grid.

For grid-connected scenarios, managing the operation of electrolyzers in harmony with the electric grid and other energy demands becomes important. Research on energy management algorithms for hydrogen-integrated power systems is burgeoning. Advanced control strategies like model predictive control and even artificial intelligence techniques are being tested to optimally dispatch electrolyzers, especially under uncertainty in renewable output and electricity prices @shiResearchEnergyManagement2023 . For example, Shi _et al._ (2023) propose a deep reinforcement learning approach to coordinate a “hydrogen-electric coupling system” consisting of wind, solar, electrolyzers, and power demand response @shiResearchEnergyManagement2023 . The goal of such operational strategies is to maximize economic returns (or minimize costs) while respecting the real-time constraints of the grid and maximizing the utilization of renewable energy. Initial studies suggest that intelligent control can significantly improve outcomes, enabling electrolyzers to ramp up when renewable generation peaks or electricity prices are low, and ramp down when power is scarce or expensive @shiResearchEnergyManagement2023 . This not only produces hydrogen at lower cost but can also provide grid services (like absorbing excess power or providing load shedding on demand). However, a challenge noted in the literature is that frequent start-stop cycles and load fluctuations may impact electrolyzer efficiency and degradation. Many PEM electrolyzer models historically were developed for steady-state or slowly changing conditions, and dynamic performance – including issues like transient response, efficiency at partial loads, and accelerated aging due to power cycling – is an area requiring further research @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Addressing these dynamic behavior gaps will be critical as electrolyzers are increasingly expected to behave as flexible loads in renewable energy systems.

On the planning and design side, there is active work on optimizing the capacity and mix of renewable energy sources dedicated to hydrogen production. A key question for large “power-to-hydrogen” projects is the optimal sizing of resources: how big should the electrolyzer be relative to the renewable capacity, and should one invest in multiple energy sources to mitigate intermittency? Astriani _et al._ (2024) tackled this by optimizing renewable energy parks for hydrogen production under three configurations: PV-only, wind-only, and a hybrid PV+wind scenario@astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . They incorporated detailed cost and efficiency curves for a PEM electrolyzer, as well as location-specific wind and solar resource data, to find the designs that minimize hydrogen LCOH@astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024  @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . Their findings illustrate the value of resource diversity: in a case study location (Adum-Kirkeby, Denmark), a wind-only configuration yielded the lowest hydrogen cost ($4.26/kg) thanks to excellent wind speeds, whereas a PV-only setup was much more expensive ($14.38/kg) in that same location due to poor solar availability@astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . A hybrid PV-wind system reduced cost compared to PV-only, demonstrating that combining resources can hedge against the variability of each @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024  @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . Interestingly, Astriani _et al._ identified an optimal PV-to-wind capacity ratio of about 65:35 for that region, suggesting that even in a wind-favored site, some solar capacity helps utilize the electrolyzer more consistently @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . They also found that hydrogen cost was more sensitive to the electrolyzer capital cost than to the electricity tariff or curtailment losses @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 . This again underlines how critical lowering electrolyzer costs is, even in the context of abundant renewable energy – an expensive electrolyzer that is underutilized will yield high-cost hydrogen. Other studies similarly emphasize locating hydrogen production where renewable resources are strong and utilization can be maximized. For instance, projects in the U.S. are examining the Midwest for wind-to-hydrogen or the Southwest for solar-to-hydrogen, leveraging regional resource strengths (these mirror global findings, like Denmark’s wind in the Astriani study). Site selection, resource assessment, and hybridization (wind+solar) are therefore key considerations in the design of renewable hydrogen systems @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024  @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 .

From a broader energy systems perspective, integrating hydrogen has implications beyond just making cheap hydrogen; it can contribute to decarbonizing multiple sectors. Excess renewable electricity converted to hydrogen can be used for heavy transportation (fuel cell vehicles or hydrogen combustion), for industrial processes (replacing fossil-derived hydrogen in ammonia production, refining, steelmaking, etc.), or even injected into natural gas pipelines (up to certain limits) to lower the carbon intensity of delivered gas. These cross-sector uses mean that hydrogen bridges the power grid with other parts of the energy economy. However, this also introduces techno-economic considerations such as the need for storage buffers, compression or liquefaction of hydrogen, distribution infrastructure, and the round-trip efficiency if converting back to power. Those topics extend beyond the scope of this section, but they are important to note as part of the renewable energy system landscape. Current literature identifies a few gaps and challenges in the renewable-hydrogen integration domain. One major challenge is scaling up proven concepts to the multi-gigawatt scale needed for national or global impact – many studies are theoretical or at pilot scale, and real-world validation is needed to confirm cost and performance assumptions (e.g., how a GW-scale electrolyzer plant operates in a real grid). Another gap is the durability of electrolyzers under renewable-driven duty cycles: as mentioned, variable operations could shorten stack life, and quantifying this through experiments and incorporating it into economic models is a work in progress @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Additionally, policy and market frameworks will heavily influence renewable hydrogen systems – for example, grid connection rules, dynamic electricity pricing, and incentives for green hydrogen all affect viability. While our focus here is on technical literature, it is worth noting that many techno-economic studies assume certain policy supports (like carbon prices or subsidies) to make green hydrogen competitive with fossil fuels @jangTechnoeconomicAnalysisMonte2022 . Balancing all these factors, renewable energy systems with integrated hydrogen production are increasingly seen as a cornerstone of a future low-carbon energy infrastructure. The literature shows clear consensus that using curtailed or dedicated renewable power for hydrogen is not only feasible, but, with continuing improvements, can become cost-competitive with conventional hydrogen. The remaining research is honing in on optimizing designs (from component-level to system-level), improving electrolyzer resilience and flexibility, and reducing costs across the board. These efforts collectively aim to close the gap between the promise of green hydrogen and the practical realization of sustainable, economically viable hydrogen energy systems @doeHydrogenShot2020

# # Hydrogen Production via PEM Electrolysis: Literature Review

## Modeling Approaches and Design Advances

**Electrochemical Modeling of PEM Electrolyzers:** Models for PEM water electrolyzers typically decompose the cell voltage into an ideal thermodynamic component plus several overpotential losses @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 , @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . The key loss terms include _activation overpotentials_ (at anode and cathode, due to sluggish reaction kinetics), _ohmic losses_ (from ionic resistance in the membrane and electronic resistances in electrodes/interconnects), and _concentration or mass transport overpotentials_ (caused by gas bubble accumulation and reactant depletion at high current) @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020  @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Butler–Volmer kinetics (and its Tafel slope simplification) is widely employed to model the activation losses; most PEM electrolyzer models use some form of the Butler–Volmer equation to relate current density and overpotential @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . However, formulation details can vary (e.g. whether to include a symmetry-factor of 2 in the exponential term), and authors must choose appropriate charge-transfer coefficients and exchange current densities for the hydrogen and oxygen electrodes @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Ohmic losses are usually modeled as a simple linear term $i \cdot R$ (with $R$ coming from membrane ionic resistance and other cell resistances), while mass transport losses can be represented by empirical limiting-current formulations or semi-empirical corrections at high currents @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . These modeling approaches, when calibrated to experiments, allow prediction of polarization curves (voltage vs. current behavior) under various conditions and provide insight into efficiency losses at different operating points @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020  @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Dynamic models have also been developed (including capacitive terms for transient response), but many studies focus on steady-state performance unless coupling to renewable power profiles where transient behavior is important @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020  @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 .

**Gas Crossover and Faradaic Efficiency:** A unique aspect of water electrolysis modeling is accounting for gas crossover between the anode and cathode. Hydrogen produced at the cathode can permeate through the polymer membrane to the oxygen side (and vice versa for oxygen to the hydrogen side), especially at high pressure or with thinner membranes. This effect lowers the _Faraday efficiency_ (also called current efficiency), since a portion of the current does not lead to collectible hydrogen @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . In modeling terms, Faraday efficiency $\eta_F$ is often introduced as the fraction of the theoretical hydrogen production that is actually realized. A $\eta_F$ less than 100% is caused by parasitic currents and gas losses through the membrane @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Empirical equations (e.g. from old alkaline electrolyzer studies by Hug and Ulleberg) are sometimes used to fit $\eta_F$ as a function of current density, pressure, and temperature @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020  @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Notably, Faraday efficiency drops significantly at low current densities because the fixed-rate gas permeation becomes a larger fraction of the small hydrogen production rate @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Thinner membranes exacerbate crossover (lower transport resistance for gas), so while they reduce ohmic loss, they can decrease efficiency and even pose safety hazards (hydrogen accumulation on the O₂ side) if operated at low loads @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . **Shunt currents** are another faradaic loss mechanism in multi-cell stacks: these are parasitic currents that bypass some cells through the electrolyte or external piping/manifolds. They effectively divert current away from water-splitting reactions, lowering efficiency. Shunt currents are influenced by stack design and materials (e.g. conductive paths in the bipolar plates or manifolds) @yodwongFaradaysEfficiencyModeling2020. Studies note that current leakages can be diagnosed by comparing measured gas output to theoretical values @yodwongFaradaysEfficiencyModeling2020 . In short, both gas crossover and shunt currents must be accounted for in PEM electrolyzer models to accurately predict efficiency – especially for system designs with many cells or operating at high pressure. For example, on-line mass spectrometry tests have shown that hydrogen permeation rates increase with current density (due to supersaturation of dissolved H₂ in the catalyst layer), and that thin membranes dramatically boost crossover, requiring mitigation to avoid explosive H₂/O₂ mixtures at low loads @berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020  @berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020 .

**0D to 3D Modeling Fidelity:** Modeling efforts span from lumped zero-dimensional (0D) approaches up to full three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics. Simplified _0D models_ treat the cell or stack in a lumped way – using empirical or semi-empirical equations for the voltage-current behavior and efficiency. These are fast to compute and useful for system-level studies (e.g. integrating an electrolyzer model into a larger energy system simulation) @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . _1D models_ typically resolve variations through the thickness of the cell (along the direction of proton flow) or along the flow path in a single dimension – for instance, capturing concentration gradients through the MEA or along the flow channel length. Such models can include diffusion equations for gas and water through the porous transport layers and membrane, coupled with electrochemical kinetics, providing more insight into internal profiles than 0D models. _2D models_ often expand to cover the cell cross-section (for example, along the channel length and through-plane), allowing analysis of how conditions change from inlet to outlet as well as across the membrane. Finally, _3D models_ simulate the full geometry (flow field channels, electrodes, and membrane in three dimensions) using CFD techniques. These high-fidelity models capture detailed phenomena like distribution of flow between multiple parallel channels, local gas bubble behavior, and temperature gradients, at the cost of high computational complexity. **Different levels of fidelity are chosen based on the modeling goals** – simpler models for control and large-scale simulations, versus 3D models for detailed design optimization @falcaoReviewPEMElectrolyzer2020 . For example, Briguglio _et al._ (2013) carried out a 3D CFD analysis of a 10-cell PEM stack with 120 parallel channels, finding that a well-designed flow distributor yielded uniform water flow and homogeneous pressure across all cells  @briguglioDesignTestingCompact2013 . Such 3D studies help ensure there are no starvation or flooding spots in scale-up designs. On the other hand, zero-dimensional dynamic models (e.g. using empirical polarization curves and differential equations for system dynamics) have been used to simulate how a PEM electrolyzer responds to transient power input or to perform fast design-sensitivity analyses @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020  @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . In summary, contemporary literature features a **hierarchy of models**: from empirical 0D models adequate for system integration, up to detailed multiphysics models that incorporate two-phase flow and even mechanical stress analysis in the cell components.

**Flow Field and MEA Configuration:** The _flow field architecture_ and overall cell design play a crucial role in PEM electrolyzer performance. Flow fields (the patterned channels in the bipolar plates) distribute water to the anode and remove product gases; common designs include serpentine channels, parallel channels, interdigitated patterns, or porous transport media feeding water across the electrode. Serpentine flow fields tend to ensure good reactant distribution and gas removal (due to a forced convective path), but they induce higher pressure drops; parallel fields offer lower pressure drop but can suffer maldistribution (some channels carrying more flow than others)  @briguglioDesignTestingCompact2013 . Designing an optimal flow field is a trade-off between uniform reactant supply, efficient bubble removal, and pumping energy loss. In addition to flow channels, the _membrane-electrode assembly (MEA)_ configuration influences performance. PEM electrolyzers typically use a _zero-gap configuration_, where the catalyst-coated membrane is pressed directly against porous transport layers (PTLs) that also serve as gas diffusion layers. This minimizes resistance by placing catalysts in intimate contact with the membrane. MEAs can be fabricated via _catalyst-coated membrane (CCM)_ approach (catalyst ink applied directly on the membrane, e.g. by spraying or screen-printing) or by _gas diffusion electrode (GDE)_ approach (catalyst coated onto a diffusion layer and then assembled against the membrane) @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The CCM method (often via decal transfer): catalyst ink containing platinum or iridium particles and ionomer is **sprayed** or blade-coated onto a Teflon substrate, dried and hot-pressed onto the membrane @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . This yields a controlled catalyst loading and uniform layer on the membrane. The structure of the catalyst layer (porosity, thickness, ionomer content) is critical – it must allow water access and gas escape while providing ionic contact to the membrane and electronic contact to the electrode. Different fabrication techniques (spraying, painting, physical deposition) and catalyst ink formulations can lead to different microstructures and performance. Research has shown that achieving a homogeneous, well-dispersed catalyst layer improves utilization of precious metals and can allow lower loadings without sacrificing performance @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . For instance, earlier PEMWE designs often had very high platinum loadings on the cathode, but it was realized that hydrogen evolution is facile and does not require such excess catalyst. Cathode loadings dropped into the ~0.5–1.0 mg/cm² range without performance loss @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The anode (oxygen evolution) side is more challenging; typical Iridium loadings were ~2 mg/cm² and have not dramatically decreased historically @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . New coating methods (e.g. depositing iridium nanoparticles onto conductive supports, or advanced sputtering techniques) have achieved lower Ir loadings – in one study to ~0.3 mg/cm² – while maintaining performance @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . In general, improved catalyst-layer fabrication (for example, using refined ink and spray techniques) can increase catalyst utilization (more of the catalyst surface is active) so that less total metal is needed @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Aside from catalysts, other design factors include the membrane thickness and reinforcement (mechanical supports or cloth within the membrane to improve strength) and the use of advanced coatings on bipolar plates or PTLs (such as titanium coatings or hydrophilic treatments) to enhance durability and performance. Each of these design choices – flow field pattern, MEA fabrication method, catalyst loading – can significantly affect efficiency, voltage performance, and durability of the electrolyzer.

**Membrane and Catalyst Material Innovations:** Conventional PEM electrolyzers use perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer membranes (e.g. Nafion™) due to their high proton conductivity and chemical stability. However, PFSA membranes are expensive and have some limitations (they perform best under well-humidified conditions and have an upper thermal limit around 80–90 °C) @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . In recent years, _hydrocarbon-based membranes_ (non-fluorinated or partially fluorinated ionomers) have been researched as lower-cost alternatives. These membranes (often sulfonated aromatic polymers) can be cheaper to produce and avoid some environmental concerns of PFSA, but historically they showed lower performance or stability. Encouragingly, recent advances have yielded hydrocarbon MEAs approaching the performance of PFSA-based systems @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Hydrocarbon ionomers can have higher glass transition temperatures and potentially allow operation at >100 °C, addressing PFSA’s thermal limitation @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . However, challenges remain: PFSA membranes have an inherent advantage in chemical stability (resisting oxidative radicals) and mechanical robustness when reinforced @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Hydrocarbon membranes must be engineered to avoid excessive swelling or degradation. Studies like Nguyen _et al._ (2022) report that fully hydrocarbon MEAs can now achieve comparable current densities and durability to Nafion-based MEAs in electrolysis, which is a promising development @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Still, a known issue is that thinner membranes (whether PFSA or hydrocarbon) lead to higher gas crossover; for example, state-of-the-art PFSA electrolyzers often use thick membranes (e.g. Nafion 115 at 125 μm or even N117 at 180 μm) to minimize hydrogen permeation @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Using thinner membranes would improve conductivity and efficiency, but at the expense of more crossover and potentially reduced mechanical durability @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Thus, new membrane materials aim to combine high conductivity with the ability to be made thin without sacrificing gas separation or strength @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 .

On the electrocatalyst side, PEM electrolyzers currently rely on precious metals: platinum (Pt) at the cathode for hydrogen evolution, and iridium (Ir) or iridium oxide at the anode for oxygen evolution (ruthenium has also been used in IrO₂/RuO₂ mixtures, but pure RuO₂ is less stable under the anodic conditions)   @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The scarcity and cost of these noble metals drive research into **lowering catalyst loading** and finding **non-precious-metal catalysts**. Reducing catalyst loading has seen substantial success: as mentioned, the Pt required on the cathode is quite low (0.5 mg/cm² or even less) without much performance loss @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . The anode Ir loading has been harder to reduce because the OER is kinetically demanding and the acidic environment corrodes most base metals. Nonetheless, advanced iridium nanostructures and high-surface-area supports (TiO₂, SnO₂, etc.) have allowed lower Ir loadings with comparable performance. For instance, supported Ir or RuO₂ on antimony-doped SnO₂ was explored to increase utilization of the precious catalyst @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . One study showed an Ir/Ru catalyst on a conductive oxide support achieving the same performance at ~0.3 mgIr/cm² as a conventional catalyst at 1.0 mgIr/cm² @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Completely _non-precious OER catalysts_ (e.g. transition metal oxides without Ir) have been investigated (such as cobalt or manganese oxides, or novel mixed metal catalysts), but so far none can match the stability of Ir-based catalysts in acidic PEM conditions for long lifetimes @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . Non-precious options tend to either dissolve, passivate, or lose activity relatively quickly in the harsh OER environment. On the HER side, some non-precious catalysts (like NiMo or tungsten carbides) work in alkaline media, but in PEM (acidic) they either dissolve or require protective layers. Thus, research has also looked at _alloying and nano-engineering_ the precious metals: for example, alloying Pt with transition metals to reduce content, or developing new catalyst morphologies (e.g. nanowires, thin films) that maximize surface area per mass. Overall, **materials advances** in membranes and catalysts are gradually driving improvements – with hydrocarbon membranes promising cost and temperature benefits, and catalyst innovations aiming to maintain performance while cutting PGM usage @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . In parallel, durability of these new materials is a major focus (addressing issues like catalyst particle growth, support corrosion, membrane chemical degradation by radicals, etc.), since any new material must still achieve the >5–10 year lifetimes expected of electrolyzer stacks @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022.

**Influence of Key Design and Operating Parameters:** The performance of a PEM electrolyzer stack is strongly dependent on various design parameters and operating conditions. **Thickness of components** is one important factor. A thinner polymer membrane will have lower ionic resistance (improving voltage efficiency) but higher gas crossover as discussed, and potentially shorter life due to mechanical stress or chemical attack @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022. Thicker membranes (>150 μm) virtually eliminate H₂ crossover even at high pressure, but at the cost of a higher cell voltage from ohmic drop @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022  @nguyenFullyHydrocarbonMembrane2022 . Similarly, the thickness (or loading) of catalyst layers and porous transport layers can influence performance: a thicker catalyst layer may lead to more oxygen gas trapped and diffusion limitations within the layer, whereas too thin a layer might not fully utilize the incoming current (if catalyst is insufficient or unevenly distributed). Han _et al._ (2015) found that changes in either electrode or membrane thickness had significant impact on performance due to their contributions to diffusion and ohmic losses@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 @hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 . In their model, adding an interfacial contact resistance (between electrode and membrane) was crucial; this interfacial resistance could account for ~32% of the total ohmic loss at 1.5 A/cm²@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 @hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 . This indicates that how well the electrodes are bonded to the membrane (affected by fabrication method and compression) matters as much as bulk material resistances.

_Operating temperature_ is another critical parameter. Higher temperatures accelerate the reaction kinetics and improve membrane conductivity, thus lowering the cell voltage for a given current@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 . For example, increasing cell temperature was observed to shift the polarization curve favorably (higher current at the same voltage) due to reduced activation and ohmic losses@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 . However, running at higher temperature can exacerbate degradation (membrane chemical decay, catalyst corrosion) and is limited by the membrane’s ability to retain water and structural integrity. Most PFSA-based systems run up to ~80 °C; operation above that may require pressurization to keep the membrane hydrated and specialized membranes or additives to prevent degradation. _Operating pressure_ has a more complex influence. On one hand, raising the oxygen or hydrogen pressure increases the Nernst equilibrium voltage (roughly a 50 mV increase for hydrogen from 1 bar to 30 bar according to one study) @berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020  @berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020 , meaning the thermodynamic requirement is higher. Empirically, higher pressure often _increases_ the cell voltage at a given current (slightly lower efficiency)@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 . This is mainly because of the higher equilibrium potential and possibly increased gas dissolution in the electrolyte leading to more supersaturation-related losses @berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020 . On the other hand, operating at pressure directly yields compressed hydrogen, which can be economically favorable overall (reducing downstream compression needs). Some studies also suggest that moderate pressurization can improve performance by suppressing bubble volume (thus reducing two-phase resistances), but the net effect is usually a small voltage penalty@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 . Han _et al._ noted in their model that increasing pressure from 1 atm to several atm led to a higher operating voltage, governed mostly by the change in open-circuit voltage@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015 .

Other parameters include _current density_: designing the stack for higher current density (e.g. 2 A/cm² vs 1 A/cm²) increases hydrogen production rate per cell area (reducing capital cost per kg H₂), but it also raises all overpotentials (activation, ohmic, mass transport) and thus lowers efficiency. High current operation also generates more heat and gas, potentially stressing materials (for instance, more rapid catalyst degradation or membrane chemical attack by radicals at high flux). _Water flow rate and water quality_ affect performance as well – insufficient water feed can dry out the membrane or cause local hot spots, and impurities in water (metal ions) can foul the membrane or catalyze membrane degradation via Fenton reactions @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022. Therefore, maintaining adequate excess water flow and high purity (often deionized water with resistivity >1 MΩ·cm is used) is standard practice. In summary, **design/operating parameters trade-offs** are carefully optimized: higher temperature improves efficiency but may shorten life; higher pressure aids hydrogen delivery but slightly hurts cell efficiency; thinner membranes and higher current densities yield more compact, cheaper systems (more output for a given size) but can reduce efficiency and longevity@hanElectrochemicalPerformanceModeling2015  @berntAnalysisGasPermeation2020 . These effects are quantified by both modeling and experimental parametric studies in the literature, to guide the engineering of stacks for various applications (for instance, a system for intermittent renewable power might favor a design that tolerates dynamic operation and many on/off cycles, whereas a base-load hydrogen plant might optimize for peak efficiency at steady operation).

**Performance, Cost, and Durability Trade-offs:** In designing PEM electrolyzer systems, engineers must balance performance goals against cost and durability constraints – and often improving one aspect comes at the expense of another. A clear example is the **membrane thickness trade-off**: a thinner membrane gives lower internal resistance (thus higher efficiency and the ability to run at higher current density) but it also tends to have a shorter lifespan and greater hydrogen crossover @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 @hernandez-gomezInvestigationPEMElectrolyzer2020 . Over time, chemical and mechanical degradation will thin the membrane anyway; if it becomes too thin or develops defects, it can lead to gas leaks, electrode delamination, or even hazardous H₂/O₂ mixtures @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022. Thus, while advanced membranes are being developed to be thin **and** robust, current systems often use a conservatively thick membrane to ensure durability, sacrificing some performance. **Catalyst loading and composition** present another trade-off: using less iridium or platinum (or cheaper substitute catalysts) can dramatically cut material cost, but typically at a loss of performance or durability. As one review noted, efforts to reduce noble metal loading or use alternative catalysts "usually result in decreased performance levels" compared to the state-of-the-art catalysts @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . For instance, non-precious metal catalysts for the OER might work initially but could corrode rapidly, meaning the stack would not meet longevity targets. Even within precious metals, using an alloy or a supported catalyst might lower cost but could introduce instability (e.g. ruthenium can boost OER activity and reduce Ir content, but Ru can dissolve if the potential or temperature spikes). Therefore, the **cost-performance trade-off** is often about finding the minimum precious metal that still gives acceptable performance and life. Recent advances like novel iridium oxide nanostructures show improved utilization (thus lower required loading) – but the manufacturability of these advanced catalysts at scale and their long-term stability are still under evaluation.

There are also trade-offs in **balance-of-plant and system design**. For example, to mitigate gas crossover in a very thin membrane, one might add recombination catalyst layers or sensors, but these increase complexity and cost. Running at high pressure can save on external compressor cost, but it requires thicker walled hardware and careful control to avoid exacerbating shunt currents or leaks. Similarly, _bipolar plates (BPs)_ and other hardware can be made of expensive corrosion-proof materials (titanium with noble metal coatings) to enhance durability, or cheaper materials (stainless steel) that are coated/protected – the latter may lower upfront cost but risk any coating failure causing degradation. A 2022 review points out that titanium BPs and porous transport layers are often coated with Pt, Au, or Ir to prevent corrosion and minimize contact resistance; these coatings improve performance and longevity but obviously increase cost, so designers must weigh the benefit vs. cost of such treatments @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022. Indeed, it was noted that the _“balance between performance and overall cost must be considered”_ when deciding on noble metal coatings for bipolar plates @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022. Another trade-off is **operating window vs. durability**: PEM electrolyzers can ramp quickly and operate dynamically (unlike alkaline systems), but frequent load cycles or standby periods can accelerate certain degradation modes (e.g. transient IR drop causing local hot spots or repeated mechanical expansion/contraction in membrane). If a stack is optimized purely for efficiency at steady-state, it might not handle dynamic operation as well. Hence, designs for renewable-integrated electrolyzers may deliberately oversize or use more robust components to handle start-stop conditions, accepting a higher initial cost for better lifetime. In summary, contemporary research and engineering of PEM electrolyzers is very much an exercise in **optimization**: achieving high performance (high efficiency and output density) while using durable materials and minimal costly components. The literature highlights that pushing any single metric (efficiency, power density, or low cost) in isolation is counterproductive – instead, a well-balanced design is sought, often through iterative modeling and testing to find the sweet spot where performance is maximized **per unit cost** and maintained over the desired lifetime @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022.

## Techno-Economic Analysis and System-Level Modeling

**Methodologies for Cost and Economic Analysis:** Techno-economic analysis (TEA) of PEM hydrogen systems typically involves computing the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) – i.e. the cost per kilogram of H₂ produced, accounting for capital expenditures (CAPEX), operational expenditures (OPEX), and financial factors. A common approach is to use a **discounted cash flow model** over the project lifetime. For example, the U.S. DOE’s H2A model is frequently used; it computes the required hydrogen selling price for a target internal rate of return (IRR) given all capital, operating, and maintenance costs@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . The methodology usually includes: defining the system design and performance (efficiencies, degradation, capacity factor), estimating the **Bill of Materials and capital costs** for the electrolyzer stack and balance of plant, estimating operating costs (primarily electricity, plus water, maintenance, labor, etc.), and then calculating annual cash flows over the plant life@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . Many analyses assume an economic life on the order of 20 years for a plant (though some consider longer for central plants) and include stack replacement if the stack life is shorter. The output of such models is an LCOH in $/kg H₂, which can be compared to targets or to alternative hydrogen sources. This standardized approach allows consistent comparisons across different hydrogen production pathways@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014. In TEA literature, one starts by establishing a **base case** (with current technology and costs) and then performs _sensitivity analyses_ to see which parameters most affect the hydrogen cost@colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . For instance, a sensitivity tornado chart might show how the LCOH changes if electricity price varies by ±50%, or if stack cost is reduced by half, etc. These help identify key cost drivers. Advanced TEA studies may also integrate **system-level modeling**: for example, coupling an electrolyzer model with a renewable energy profile or grid model to optimize operating strategies. A recent trend is to include **dynamic operation and optimization** – recognizing that if using grid electricity, operating the electrolyzer flexibly (to take advantage of low power prices) can reduce average cost. Chung _et al._ (2024) introduced a combined physics-based electrolyzer model with an optimization routine to evaluate both steady and dynamic operations on LCOH @chungDesignSpacePEM2024  @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . Such methods go beyond static cost calculations, examining how capacity optimization, scheduling, and even demand response could impact economics. In summary, the TEA methodologies in the past decade have evolved from straightforward cost accounting to more sophisticated models that can account for manufacturing scale, temporal operation patterns, and integration into energy networks.

**Manufacturing Cost Models and Scaling Laws:** The production cost of PEM electrolyzer stacks is highly sensitive to manufacturing scale and learning rates. Early PEM systems were essentially boutique constructions with very high costs, but as the industry scales to megawatt and gigawatt levels, economies of scale are expected to drive costs down considerably. TEA studies incorporate this through _manufacturing cost models_ that estimate how the cost per kW of the stack (and BoP) decreases with larger production volume and system size. Empirical **scaling laws** are often used: for example, a common rule is that cost scales roughly with some exponent less than 1 (economy of scale), meaning a 10× larger plant might cost only ~5–7× as much (reducing cost per unit of capacity). Similarly, learning curve models predict that for every doubling of cumulative production, the unit cost falls by a certain percentage (the “learning rate”). In the context of PEM electrolysis, recent analyses and historical data suggest significant cost improvements as manufacturing ramps up. Yates _et al._ (2020) identified electrolyzer system size as the single most important factor influencing hydrogen cost in their Monte Carlo analysis – in their model, scaling the nominal electrolyzer power up by a factor of 10 could reduce LCOH by around $0.3 per kg (all else equal) @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . Another literature estimate (Bruce _et al._, as cited by Yates) indicated that a 10× scale-up might cut hydrogen cost by over $1/kg due to economies of scale @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . The reasoning is straightforward: larger systems spread fixed costs (like control systems, housing, etc.) over more output, and higher production volumes of stacks enable automated manufacturing, bulk material purchasing, and design optimization for mass production. These effects are reflected in projections: for example, the U.S. DOE “Future” case for a central PEM plant (assuming high-volume manufacturing by 2025) assumed a stack cost of ~$0.17 per kg H₂ (contributing to LCOH) compared to ~$0.42 per kg in a current small-scale case @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . This corresponds to stack capital cost dropping from hundreds of dollars per kW to on the order of tens of dollars per kW with scaled-up production. Policy and industry roadmaps anticipate multi-GW per year production of electrolyzers could bring stack costs down dramatically by the 2030 timeframe. **Balance-of-plant** components also benefit from scaling (e.g. larger rectifiers have lower $/kW cost, larger tanks or compressors benefit from bulk scaling). It is important to note there are _two_ kinds of scaling: **plant size scaling** (larger single projects reduce specific costs) and **industry cumulative scaling** (learning rate over time). Both are considered in techno-economic models for future scenario forecasting. A conclusion from many studies is that achieving very low hydrogen costs will likely require both very large plant sizes (hundreds of MW to GW-scale electrolyzer installations) and the maturation of a global supply chain for electrolyzer manufacturing @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . In practical terms, this means encouraging initial deployments that are large enough to capture economies of scale. Yates _et al._ noted that demonstrating projects on the order of _hundreds of megawatts_ would help significantly in driving down LCOH by enabling manufacturers to scale up production facilities and reduce costs @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 .

**Key Cost Drivers and Cost Composition:** Across numerous techno-economic assessments, a few cost factors consistently emerge as the dominant drivers of hydrogen cost from PEM electrolysis. The price of electricity is usually the #1 driver for LCOH @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . Electrolysis is energy-intensive (requiring ~50–55 kWh of electricity per kg H₂ produced at lower heating value), so the cost of that electricity directly translates to hydrogen cost. As an illustration, if electricity costs $0.06/kWh, the energy cost alone is about $3/kg H₂     @groenemansTechnoeconomicAnalysisOffshore2022 . Indeed, a detailed H2A case study confirmed that the most sensitive input parameter is the cost of electricity (feedstock), more so than any capital factor @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . The second major driver is the **capital cost of the electrolyzer system** (including the stack and balance-of-plant) @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . Capital cost influences the hydrogen cost via the annualized cost (depreciation or financing of the equipment) per unit of hydrogen output, which depends on both the upfront cost and the utilization (capacity factor). For a given utilization, lower capital cost directly lowers the $/(kg H₂) by reducing the amortized cost component. A sensitivity analysis by James _et al._ (2013) showed electricity price and electrolyzer capital cost at the top of the list for both small and large plant scenarios, far above factors like catalyst price or labor cost in impact @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 .

In terms of **cost composition**, current PEM electrolysis hydrogen cost is often split roughly as 60–70% electricity, and 30–40% from capital-related charges (plus a few percent from O&M) in high-utilization scenarios @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . For example, one baseline analysis (assuming ~6 ¢/kWh power and 90% capacity factor) estimated an LCOH of about $5.1/kg, with $3.3/kg coming from electricity, ~$1.3/kg from the capital recovery, and the remainder from O&M and other costs @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . This underscores how dominant the electricity supply is – if cheap surplus renewable electricity is available (say at 2–3 ¢/kWh), the LCOH can drop dramatically. On the capital side, the **stack vs. balance-of-plant (BoP)** breakdown is also informative. PEM stacks (membrane, electrodes, bipolar plates, etc.) typically account for roughly 40–50% of the total installed system cost, while BoP (power electronics, gas dryers, pumps, cooling system, housing, etc.) accounts for the other ~50–60% @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . For instance, a study showed stack ~41% and BoP ~59% of direct costs in a forecourt-scale system, and a similar split in a larger central system @colellaTechnoeconomicAnalysisPEM2014 . Within the stack cost, the expensive components are the membrane and catalysts (iridium in particular): these high materials costs mean that even if their quantities are small, they contribute a significant share. One analysis estimated that the catalyst and membrane together could be ~15–20% of the total system cost in current designs @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013  @carmoComprehensiveReviewPEM2013 . BoP cost drivers include the DC power supply/rectifier (often a big cost item), and any hydrogen compression or drying equipment needed. In certain designs, if high-pressure hydrogen output is required, the electrolyzer may be designed to pressurize hydrogen internally, which shifts some cost from an external compressor into the cell components (thicker endplates, etc.). **Balance-of-plant simplification** is an area of active development (for example, eliminating a circulation pump by passive water feed, or integrating the cooling system more compactly) to cut costs[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885563354890)[Box](https://app.box.com/file/1885563354890). Another consideration is _lifetime and degradation_: if the stack needs replacement every, say, 7 years, that adds to effective annual capital cost. Improving durability (to extend stack life) will reduce the lifecycle cost – so in TEAs the **stack lifetime** assumption is a crucial parameter. Many studies assume ~60,000–80,000 hours stack life (7–9 years at full usage) for future PEM systems, in line with DOE targets, though current demonstrated lifetimes are somewhat lower. Shorter stack life means more frequent replacements and higher effective cost per kg H₂, unless mitigated by warranties or refurbishments.

**LCOH Findings and Scenario Analysis:** Recent literature reports a range of levelized hydrogen costs for PEM electrolysis, depending on assumptions about technology status, scale, and energy inputs. For current (circa 2020) technology at scale, **LCOH values around $4–$7 per kg** are common in studies @chungDesignSpacePEM2024  @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . For example, Chung _et al._ (2024) evaluated a 50,000 kg H₂/day (~200 MW) grid-powered PEM plant. Using 2021 costs and electricity prices, they found an LCOH of about $4.98/kg under steady operation, which could drop to $4.57/kg (about 8% reduction) if operated dynamically to take advantage of cheaper off-peak electricity @chungDesignSpacePEM2024  @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . This analysis assumed a maximum current density of 2 A/cm² and electricity around $50/MWh, and it reflects a large-scale installation. The same study projected that with **future 2035** technology improvements (e.g. doubling current density capability to 4 A/cm², lower capital cost, and cheaper electricity from renewables), the LCOH could range from $2.18 to $3.93/kg (static operation) and as low as $1.42 to $2.84/kg under optimized dynamic operation @chungDesignSpacePEM2024  @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . The lower end of $1.4/kg would correspond to very low-cost electricity and high utilization, achieving the kind of cost that can compete with steam methane reforming with carbon capture. Another study by Groenemans _et al._ (2022) looked at offshore wind-powered PEM electrolysis and found that directly coupling an electrolyzer to a dedicated offshore wind farm could produce hydrogen at an estimated $2.09/kg, versus about $3.86/kg if the wind power were first transmitted to shore and then used for electrolysis     @groenemansTechnoeconomicAnalysisOffshore2022      @groenemansTechnoeconomicAnalysisOffshore2022 . The difference came from avoiding grid connection costs and intermediate conversion losses by directly producing hydrogen offshore. This illustrates how **system design choices** (integrated renewable-electrolyzer configurations) can change the economics. Meanwhile, Yates _et al._ (2020) studied a stand-alone solar-PV powered electrolyzer with energy storage for off-grid hydrogen production. They reported LCOH values that were higher (due to PV and storage costs), but through extensive uncertainty analysis they identified pathways to get competitive hydrogen – namely, continuing to reduce PV costs, building at large scale in very sunny locations, and improving electrolyzer efficiency and capital cost @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . Their Monte Carlo simulation emphasized the importance of low-cost solar electricity and scale, concluding that in remote areas with excellent solar resources and multi-MW scale systems, hydrogen could approach $5–$6/kg with current tech, and potentially $3–$4/kg with foreseeable improvements @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020  @yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020 . It’s worth noting that _capacity factor_ plays a big role: using an electrolyzer only intermittently (to soak up surplus renewable power) improves the utilization of renewable energy but yields a higher hydrogen cost because the capital is under-utilized. Conversely, running at a high capacity factor (which might mean drawing some electricity from the grid or a steady source to keep it running) spreads the capital cost over more hydrogen and lowers LCOH. Many TEA scenarios examine this balance between cheap but intermittent power vs. slightly more expensive but steadier power supply.

**Profitability, Breakeven, and Cost Targets:** The ultimate question for many is when and how PEM electrolytic hydrogen can become economically competitive with incumbent hydrogen (fossil-based) or reach certain cost targets (such as the U.S. DOE "Hydrogen Shot" goal of $1/kg by 2030). Based on the literature, **breakeven with conventional hydrogen (~$1.5–$2/kg from natural gas without carbon tax)** will likely require a combination of ultra-low-cost electricity and very low capital costs at large scale. The 2035 scenario from Chung _et al._ where LCOH might hit $1.4/kg is an optimistic case that assumes significant technology and cost improvements @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 . It suggests that by mid-2030s, PEM electrolysis _could_ produce hydrogen in the $1–$2/kg range in favorable regions (e.g. with abundant cheap renewables), which would undercut even methane reforming with carbon capture. In the nearer term, analyses indicate that reaching about $2/kg (a often-cited benchmark for competitiveness with grey hydrogen plus carbon pricing) is plausible by the late 2020s if certain conditions are met: roughly, electricity at $20/MWh or below, electrolyzer capital costs halved from today, and high utilization (or some form of revenue stacking/grid services to compensate if utilization is low). Many studies show current costs in the $5/kg ballpark, so getting to $2 involves roughly a 60% cost reduction – which aligns with expected improvements from scale and cheaper renewables. For instance, a scenario with $0.02–$0.03/kWh wind or solar and a large 100 MW electrolyzer plant (capital cost perhaps $300–$400/kW) could yield hydrogen at $2–$3/kg according to several models @chungDesignSpacePEM2024      @groenemansTechnoeconomicAnalysisOffshore2022 . Profitability for project developers will depend on the price of hydrogen they can sell at. In niche markets (like hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles or for renewable refining processes), hydrogen may already fetch $5–$10/kg, which can make some early projects viable with subsidies. However, for large-scale fuel or industrial use, the selling price needs to approach the $2/kg range. **Breakeven scale** is an important concept highlighted in TEAs: smaller systems (a few MW or less) produce very costly hydrogen (> $8/kg in some cases) due to poor economies of scale @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . Only when plants reach tens of MW (producing on the order of tonnes of H₂ per day) do we see the cost per kg come down substantially. The H2A case studies showed that a forecourt-scale unit (1,500 kg H₂/day, ~5 MW) had a hydrogen cost about $5.15/kg, while a central plant (50,000 kg/day, ~165 MW) was about $5.12/kg under similar assumptions – indicating that scale alone in that comparison didn’t change it dramatically because both were assumed to run at high capacity @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . But when including _distribution_ costs (compression, storage, dispensing for the forecourt), the smaller-scale case ended up around $7.5/kg delivered @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013  @jamesPEMElectrolysisH2A2013 . This highlights that large central hydrogen production avoids the expensive per-kg costs of small-scale distribution, but then one must transport hydrogen (via pipeline or trucks) which has its own costs. Each study may define “breakeven” differently, but generally the consensus is that **policy support and continued R&D are needed in the 2020s** to drive PEM electrolysis costs down to competitive levels. Encouragingly, the cost composition reveals clear levers: cheap electricity (ideally dedicated renewables) and high utilization can immediately cut LCOH, and manufacturing scale-up plus innovation can attack the capital cost. If those converge, PEM electrolyzers are projected to achieve a levelized cost of hydrogen in the low-$2 or even $1.x per kg range within the next decade @chungDesignSpacePEM2024  @chungDesignSpacePEM2024 , at which point green hydrogen becomes not just a clean alternative but an economically preferred one for many applications.

In conclusion, **hydrogen via PEM electrolysis** is an actively developing technology where both the _technical performance_ and the _economic metrics_ have seen significant advances in the past ten years. On the modeling and design side, researchers have developed robust models capturing electrochemical kinetics, fluid dynamics, and degradation, which guide improvements in materials (membranes, catalysts) and cell architecture (flow fields, MEAs) to push efficiency and longevity. These efforts have yielded cells capable of higher current densities and better durability, while also highlighting the inherent trade-offs between efficiency, cost, and durability that must be balanced in design @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022 @zhangStatusPerspectivesKey2022. On the economic front, extensive techno-economic analyses, grounded in both current data and future projections, indicate that while today’s green hydrogen is relatively expensive, there are clear pathways to cost reduction @chungDesignSpacePEM2024      @groenemansTechnoeconomicAnalysisOffshore2022 . Scaling up manufacturing and deployment is pivotal: large projects can unlock lower unit costs, and cheap renewable electricity can dominate the cost structure to drive LCOH down. Recent studies paint a hopeful picture that with sustained R&D and scaling, PEM electrolyzers can achieve the holy grail of low-cost, zero-carbon hydrogen – meeting stringent performance and durability requirements while also meeting the economic challenge of competing with entrenched fossil-fuel-based hydrogen sources. The next decade (2025–2035) is likely to see a convergence of these modeling insights and techno-economic drivers, as pilot projects inform models and models guide larger deployments, ultimately moving PEM electrolysis from a promising technology to a mainstream cornerstone of clean energy production.
