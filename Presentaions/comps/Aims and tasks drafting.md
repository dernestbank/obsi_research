For H₂ and O₂ dissolved in the membrane ($k \in \{\text{H}_2, \text{O}_2\}$):

$N_{k} = -D_{k}(\lambda) \frac{dc_{k}}{dx}$

Where:
* $D_{k}(\lambda)$: Diffusivity of gas $k$ (increasing with hydration $\lambda$).
* $c_k(x)$: Concentration of dissolved gas $k$.

**Task 1.2 {ongoing}:**  
Develop and a multi-objective optimization framework for PEM electolyser design. problem 

- [ ] diagram illustration of optimization problem
- [ ] solution from optimazion


The way to reduce capital cost and to improve efficiency is through a multiobjective to 
aligns with DOE's target for PEM electrolyser hydrogen production.




The design space is **multi-dimensional and non-linear**, involving trade-offs that cannot be optimized independently
2. Membrane Thickness: Effects and Trade-offs

A. Ohmic Overpotential ($\eta_{\text{ohm}}$):

- Thinner membranes reduce the ionic path length and improve proton conductivity.
- According to Ohm’s law:

  $$
  \eta_{\text{ohm}} = i \cdot \frac{t_{\text{mem}}}{\kappa_{\text{mem}}}
  $$

  where $\kappa_{\text{mem}}$ increases with water content and temperature.

- **Trade-off:** Thinner membranes reduce $\eta_{\text{ohm}}$ and improve energy efficiency but are more prone to **mechanical failure** and **gas crossover**.

---

B. Gas Crossover and Faraday Efficiency ($\eta_F$):

- Thinner membranes lead to higher hydrogen and oxygen permeability:

  $J_{\text{crossover}} \propto \frac{D_{\text{gas}}}{t_{\text{mem}}}$

  leading to **lower Faraday efficiency**:

  $\eta_F = 1 - \frac{i_{\text{crossover}}}{i_{\text{total}}}$$

- **Trade-off:** Higher gas crossover increases **safety risks** (H$_2$/O$_2$ mixing), **parasitic current loss**, and **thermal load** due to recombination.

C. Mechanical and Durability Considerations:

- Thinner membranes are **less robust** under pressure and hydration cycling, increasing failure risk.
- Thicker membranes offer **better chemical durability** but worsen **ohmic losses**.


 3. Catalyst Layer Thickness and Loading

A. Activation Overpotential ($\eta_{\text{act}}$):

- Increased catalyst loading (mass per unit area) provides more electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), reducing $\eta_{\text{act}}$ via:

  $$
  i = i_0 \left[ \exp\left( \frac{\alpha F \eta_{\text{act}}}{RT} \right) - 1 \right]
  $$

  where $i_0 \propto \text{ECSA}$.

- **Trade-off:** Higher loading → Lower $\eta_{\text{act}}$, but increased **material cost** (especially Ir-based OER catalysts) and thicker catalyst layer (CL).
 B. Ohmic and Mass Transport Resistance:

- Thicker catalyst layers cause:
  - Increased **proton transport resistance** due to longer ionomer paths.
  - Increased **electron path resistance** (through carbon network).
  - Potentially greater **flooding** or **gas bubble entrapment**, especially at the oxygen-evolving anode.

---

 C. Concentration Overpotential ($\eta_{\text{conc}}$):

- A thicker or denser catalyst layer can hinder gas evolution and water transport:

  $$
  \eta_{\text{conc}} = - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln\left( 1 - \frac{i}{i_L} \right)
  $$

  where $i_L$ is the limiting current density affected by **porosity**, **tortuosity**, and **pore structure**.

- **Trade-off:** Thin CL improves mass transport but may **underutilize catalyst** and raise $\eta_{\text{act}}$.



Challenge:
Objective: 
- #### Objective 1 – Minimize Specific Energy Consumption (SEC)

The Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) in units of kWh/kg H₂ is defined as the amount of electric energy required to produce 1 kg of hydrogen.
This yields the first objective function:
$f_1(x) = \text{SEC}(x) = \frac{2F \cdot V_{\text{cell}}(x)}{3600 \cdot MW_{H_2}} \quad \text{[kWh/kg-H}_2\text{]}$
where:
* $F = 96485$ C/mol (Faraday constant)
* $MW_{H_2} = 2.016 \times 10^{-3}$ kg/mol (Molar mass of Hydrogen)
* $V_{\text{cell}}(x)$ is the total cell voltage, defined via:
    $V_{\text{cell}}(x) = V_{oc}(T) + \Delta V_{\text{act}}(i, L_{\text{cat}}) + \Delta V_{\text{ohm}}(t_{\text{mem}}, t_{\text{el}}, i, T) + \Delta V_{\text{conc}}(i)$


#### Objective 2 – Minimize Physical Size of the MEA

The MEA consists of the membrane electrolyte and the electrodes.
This objective function minimizes the **stack height** per cell, influencing compactness, heat transfer, mechanical design, and materials usage.
MEA thickness reflects: Material use ( cost), device compactness ( stack height), Mechanical and thermal performance.

$$f_2(x)=t_{MEA​(x)}=t_{mem}​+t_{anode,electode}​+t_{cathode,electrode}​$$

- Minimize the cost of construction by minimizing the size-thickness of the MEA.

Minimize MEA size Total Thickness

Minimizing the total thickness of the MEA components directly relates to reducing material cost and potentially manufacturing complexity.
This directly represents minimizing the total physical thickness of the MEA layers.


### Final Problem Summary

**Decision Variables:**
$x = \begin{bmatrix} t_{\text{mem}} \\ t_{\text{el}} \\ L_{\text{cat}} \\ i \\ T \end{bmatrix}$
where:
* $t_{\text{mem}}$: Membrane thickness
* $t_{\text{el}}$: Electrode thickness (assumed uniform for anode and cathode catalyst layers)
* $L_{\text{cat}}$: Catalyst loading (assumed uniform for anode and cathode)
* $i$: Current density
* $T$: Operating temperature

**Objectives:**
Minimize Specific Energy Consumption (SEC):
$f_1(x) = \frac{2F \cdot V_{\text{cell}}(x)}{3600 \cdot MW_{H_2}}$


**Constraints:**


2.  **Mechanical durability of the membrane:**
    $g_2(x) = t_{\text{mech,min}} - t_{\text{mem}} \leq 0$
    where $t_{\text{mech,min}} = r \sqrt{\frac{k\,\Delta P\,SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}}$

3.  **Bounds on variables:**
    $t_{\text{mem,min}} \le t_{\text{mem}} \le t_{\text{mem,max}}$
    $t_{\text{el,min}} \le t_{\text{el}} \le t_{\text{el,max}}$
    $L_{\text{cat,min}} \le L_{\text{cat}} \le L_{\text{cat,max}}$
    $i_{\min} \le i \le i_{\text{lim}}$
    $T_{\min} \le T \le T_{\max}$



This multi-objective optimization problem will be solved using algorithms like NSGA-II to identify Pareto-optimal solutions, revealing the inherent trade-offs between specific energy consumption and MEA physical siz
We will use the algorithms from pymoo python library



Performance Constraint
Minimum Faradaic Efficiency
Maximum Operating Temperature
Minimum Hydrogen Production Rate

 Mechanical Durability Constraint ($g_1(x) \leq 0$):
The membrane thickness must be sufficient to withstand the pressure difference ($\Delta P$) across it, based on the simplified mechanical model.

$t_{\text{mem}} \geq r \sqrt{\frac{k \cdot \Delta P \cdot SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}}$

This is formulated as an inequality constraint:

$g_1(x) = r \sqrt{\frac{k \cdot \Delta P \cdot SF}{\sigma_{\text{tensile}}}} - t_{\text{mem}} \leq 0$

the values for $r, k, \Delta P, SF,$ and $\sigma_{\text{tensile}}$ based on your specific cell design and material properties).


The python based PEM electrolyser model will serve as the **evaluation tool** for the given design ***(set of parameters)***. The optimization algorithm uses  calculate the maximum efficiency and geometric size thickness for different MEA configurations.




Solving this multi-objective optimization problem will typically involve using specialized algorithms such as NSGA-II, MOEA/D, or other evolutionary algorithms suitable for multi-objective optimization). These algorithms explore the design space defined by the variables and constraints in our python model toevaluate the performance of each potential design.

Solving this multi-objective optimization problem will result in a set of **Pareto optimal solutions** (the Pareto front). Each point on the Pareto front represents a different MEA design where we cannot improve one objective 1 without making the other objective2 worse .increasing size of design.

For the modeling of uninstalled electrolyzer costs, the approach adopted follows the cost formulation presented by Green Hydrogen Cost Report  and Astriani et al. @astrianiOptimalPlanningRenewable2024 , which is mathematically expressed as:
$$
\text{Cost}_{EL} = c_1 + c_2 P_{EL,\text{rated}} + c_3 \, e^{c_4 \, P_{EL,\text{rated}}}
$$
where and are empirically derived constants representing baseline costs, linear scaling factors, and exponential scaling effects, respectively, and is the rated power capacity of the electrolyzer
The total uninstalled cost includes the balance-of-plant (BoP) components gas-liquid separators, compressors, pumps, thermal management systems, and water purification units

![[image-35.png]]
Operational expenditures are primarily driven by electricity consumption, accounting for the majority of ongoing costs. Accurate simulation of electrolyzer performance across a spectrum of operational scenarios is crucial for reliable estimation of electricity use and associated costs. Additional operating expenses include regular maintenance activities, periodic replacement of degraded components such as membranes and catalysts, and continuous water treatment processes. The degradation of membranes and catalysts over time notably impacts operational efficiency and component lifespan, necessitating routine assessments and targeted refurbishment strategies, thus influencing the overall calculation of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Typically, the LCOH is determined using discounted cash-flow methodologies, incorporating capital depreciation, recurring operating costs, system uptime, 

All costs are consolidated in a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) metric, defined as the cost of producing one kilogram of hydrogen over the entire project lifetime. It accounts for capital recovery, operations and maintenance, and energy input costs.

The NPV represents the present value of the project’s net cash flows over its lifetime, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC):
The IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV becomes zero.

## Basis and scenarios for ranges

**Capital cost:** Future DOE targets envision highly scaled manufacturing driving down stack and BoP costs to ≈ $800 /kW, whereas today’s smaller‐volume deployments often see up to $3 500 /kW installed capital costs.

**Fixed O&M:** Lower values reflect optimized maintenance regimes and service contracts; H2A defaults sit at 5 % of capex, while legacy systems can run closer to 8 % annually.

**Electricity cost:** At times of excess renewables, electrolyzers can procure power at $0.03 /kWh; average U.S. industrial rates hover around $0.07 /kWh, and peaking or retail rates can spike past $0.15 /kWh.

**Water cost:** Deionized water is a minor contributor, H2A assumes $0.005 /gal—but costs can vary with local treatment infrastructure.

**O₂ credit:** Many projects don’t monetize oxygen (low end), but large‐scale gas producers can sell at $0.09–0.17 /kg.

**Tax rate:** Reflects the 21 % federal corporate rate plus state levies (0–12 %), yielding combined rates from 21 % up to ≈ 33 %.

**Efficiency:** Modern PEM stacks achieve ≈ 55 kWh/kg H₂ (≈ 65 % LHV efficiency), with R&D targets pushing down toward 45 kWh/kg; less optimal designs may consume 60–65 kWh/kg.

Total non-energy feedstock includes the deionised water.
The uncertainity in non energy feedstock is lower given the deionized water can be processed onsite

### **Aim 3: Evaluate renewable energy configurations for dynamic, location-sensitive hydrogen production**

**Objective**: To assess the spatial and temporal viability of renewable-powered hydrogen production through dynamic simulation and optimization.

**Task 3.1 {completed}:**  
Design an energy system model that incorporating PV, wind, hybrid, or grid-interactive system configurations, with hourly resolution for location-specific simulations

- [ ] energy config design
- [ ] dynamic geospatial variability
- [ ] montecarlo uncertainty analysis

To account for variable energy supply scenarios, a separate modeling layer is introduced for renewable electricity provision. This includes solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind power as independent and hybrid supply configurations. For each renewable source, the capital cost $(C_{RE})$ and operating cost $O_{RE})$ are modeled as functions of installed capacity  $P$ and technology-specific scale index $s$ :
$C_{RE} = C_{ref} \cdot \left(\frac{P}{P_{ref}}\right)^{-s}; \quad O_{RE} = O_{ref} \cdot P$



Literature obtained cost prices from system design simulations indicate a cost of approximately 1,191 A$/kW$ for solar PV and 2,383 A$/kW$ for wind, based on 10 MW project scale, with negligible installation cost and an 8% land procurement cost. These values align with contemporary data compiled in utility-scale renewable energy projects

Hybrid power systems combining solar and wind in a 1:1 capacity ratio were modeled with proportional capital cost contributions and aggregate OpEx, yielding an effective system cost of 38.6 million A$ for a 20 MW plant with 210,000 A$/yr in OpEx. These values serve as input parameters for alternative electrolyzer configurations relying on off-grid renewable supply.



Alternatively, grid-connected scenarios are modeled through fixed power purchase agreement (PPA) rates or time-variable retail tariffs. In both cases, grid connection cost $C_{grid}$ and usage charges $U_{grid}$ are incorporated as lump-sum or annualized costs, which can be flexibly assigned depending on region and utility structure


![[image-8.png]]

For the renewable energy supply system (solar, wind, or hybrid), the LCOE is computed to assess the cost per unit of electricity generated
$$\mathrm{LCOE} = \frac{\mathrm{CRF} \cdot C_{RE} + O_{RE}}{E_{annual}}$$

where $C_{RE}$ is the capital cost of the renewable energy plant,  $O_{RE}$  is the annual operating cost, and $E_{annual}$ is the annual electricity production. LCOE values are benchmarked against grid electricity tariffs or PPA prices to determine economic competitiveness


Irradiance on a solar cell is a dynamic function of time of day, solar geometry, and the tilt angle of the panel. The hourly and yearly PV power output can be represented

$$
P_{PV,hY} = P_{PV,rated} f_{derPV,y} \frac{GTI_h}{G_{STC}} \left( 1 + k_p \left( T_{PV}^{h} - T_{STC} \right) \right) P_{losses}
$$
$P_{PV,rated}$ represents the rated peak capacity of the PV system under standard test conditions (STC), expressed in kilowatts (kW). To account for module efficiency reduction over time, the annual derating factor $f_{derPV,y}$ is applied.
The global tilted irradiance (${GTI_h}$), measured in kW/m², describes the solar radiation intensity incident on the tilted photovoltaic module surfaces during hour $h$ .
The cell temperature () at hour influences efficiency and energy output, adjusted against the standard temperature conditions (, typically 25°C)
Systematic losses such as inverter efficiency, cable losses, and thermal effects are accounted for in the parameter 

The modeling of wind energy generation involves calculating the wind turbine's power output as a function of wind speed, considering several performance-related factors.
$$
P_{WT} = 0.5 \eta_{WT} \rho A C_p(\lambda, \beta) v^3
$$
The power coefficient, ($C_p(\lambda, \beta$)), captures the aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine and varies according to the tip speed ratio (($\lambda$). Power coefficient from lliterature @castilloComparisonPowerCoefficients2023

- Input uncertainty captured via **Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)** for key parameters:
    - **Solar irradiance:** Often modeled using Weibulldistributions** for daily/hourly GHI depending on region.

![[Comp Report_ffz5056.pdf]]

Farhard's PhD comprehensive report, exhibits several **distinctive stylistic and structural traits** that set it apart from generic technical writing. 
Inspiration from Farhard


### **🔹 1.** **Hybrid Voice: Formal Yet Personal**

- **Balanced tone**: It’s written in a formal academic style but occasionally uses first-person plural (“we found that…”) to humanize the narration without being overly subjective.
- **Subtle author presence**: The writer doesn’t dominate the prose, but you sense the thoughtful decision-making behind the methodology, particularly in task transitions and reflections on results.

### **🔹 2.** **Logical and Modular Structure**

- **Hierarchical numbering (1.0, 2.0, 3.1, 4.2.1, etc.)** helps readers easily navigate the long document and reflects systems-thinking.
- Each section flows naturally from the previous, with transitional sentences that explain the rationale for shifting focus (e.g., from Aim 1 to Aim 2).
- Tasks are cleanly labeled and explicitly marked as {completed}, {ongoing}, or {future work}, signaling progress clearly.


### **🔹 3.**  **Integrated Technical and Societal Framing**

- Every technical method is paired with a real-world justification.
- The paper doesn’t just “model for the sake of modeling”—it constantly ties results to **economic feasibility**, **environmental impact**, or **industrial relevance**.
- Even highly technical discussions (like TEA or LCA) are embedded in a bigger narrative of **impact** and **solution-orientation**


### **🔹 4.** **Detailed but Digestible Methods**

- The methods are deeply technical, yet explained with clarity.
- When assumptions are made, the author is transparent: e.g., “We assume a recovery rate of 85% based on [X].”
- Figures and tables are referred to in-line naturally (e.g., “as shown in Figure 3”), improving readability.

### **🔹 5.** **Synthesis Over Summarization in Literature Review**

- The background section doesn’t merely summarize prior studies—it **synthesizes trends**, identifies contradictions, and **pinpoints gaps**.
- It frames each gap as motivation for a specific Aim or Task.

### **🔹 6.**  **Multi-Model Integration**

- A standout feature is the **integration of different modeling approaches**: TEA + LCA + GIS + Scenario Analysis, all tied together with consistent notation and assumptions.
- This demonstrates a **system-level understanding**, not just siloed modeling expertise.

### **🔹 7.**  **Use of Explicit Assumption & Uncertainty Language**

- Statements like “We assumed…” or “Sensitivity analysis revealed…” show academic humility and rigor.
- Limitations are not hidden—they’re framed as future work or discussion points, which adds credibility.

### **🔹 8.** **Stylistic Flow and Rhythm**

- Paragraphs are generally 4–6 sentences long, with a clear topic sentence, elaboration, and sometimes a wrap-up sentence pointing to broader implications.
- Repetitions are minimal, and synonyms are carefully chosen to avoid redundancy without sacrificing clarity.

### **🔹 9.** **Highly Referenced But Seamlessly Integrated**

- References are cited with bracketed numbers [12], but the writing does not feel citation-heavy.
- Citations are woven into the logic rather than dumped at the end of paragraphs.


### **🔹 10.**  **Framing with Vision**

- The **Introduction and Broader Impact** sections reflect a forward-looking, visionary mindset.
    
- The writer is not just fulfilling an assignment—they are **positioning the research within global challenges**, aligning with DOE goals or SDG relevance.


### **🔸 In Summary:**

This report style is:
- **Scientifically rigorous** (deep technical content)
- **Narratively coherent** (each section leads to the next)
- **Humanized but professional**
- **Systems-focused** (not just solving a problem but showing how it fits in the bigger picture)
    

It’s a **model for comprehensive exam writing** or **funding proposal narratives** where one must show technical mastery, interdisciplinary scope, and policy/industry relevance—**without sounding robotic**.

**System / Task Prompt for LLM**

You are an expert researcher preparing a formal doctoral‐level comprehensive examination report in chemical engineering (or your discipline).  The user will supply a new research topic; your task is to write a fully self-contained report that mirrors the style, tone, structure, and level of detail of the provided example.  Your report must include:

3. **1.0 Overview**
    - A narrative introduction that situates the topic in a real‐world context, highlights its importance, and previews key challenges.
    - Use engaging, human-centred language (e.g., “Plastics have become integral to modern life…”) before diving into technical specifics.
        
    
4. **2.0 Goals and Objectives**
    - State the ultimate goal(s) of the study in clear prose.
    - List 2–4 high-level research questions or objectives that the subsequent aims will address.
    
5. **3.0 Research Background**
    - Two or more subsections (e.g., 3.1 Economic Analyses, 3.2 Environmental Analyses) summarizing the state of the art.
    - Synthesize literature findings, cite key quantitative data, and identify gaps your work will fill.
6. **4.0 Proposed Research, Methods, and Results**
    - Break into **Aim 1**, **Aim 2**, **Aim 3** (as appropriate), each with descriptive titles.
    - Under each Aim, include Tasks (e.g., Task 1.1, Task 1.2, Task 1.3), marking tasks as {completed}, {ongoing}, or {future work}.
        
    - For each Task:
        - Describe methods (simulations, experiments, modeling approaches) with the same level of granularity (software used, operating conditions, key parameters).
        - Report preliminary results where available, including metrics (NPV, IRR, yields, emissions, etc.).
        - Reference figures (e.g., “Figure 1: Process flow diagram of…”).
    
7. **5.0 Intellectual Merit**
    - Concise reflection on how your integrated approach advances knowledge, connects modeling with analysis, and fills gaps in the field.
        
    
8. **6.0 Broader Impact**
    - Discussion of how results will inform policy, industry practice, or societal outcomes, with a forward-looking perspective.
    
9. **7.0 References**
    - At least 20 real or realistic peer-reviewed citations in a consistent style.
    - Include DOI or URLs and access dates for data sources.
        
    

  

**Stylistic Guidelines:**

- Write in clear, flowing academic prose (no bullet points except for listing research questions).
- Integrate humanized context sentences at the start of each major section (e.g., motivation anecdotes, real-world stakes).
- Use precise quantitative values and units.
- Label each figure and table with “Figure X:” or “Table X:” and refer to them in text.
- Mark completed tasks with {completed}, ongoing with {ongoing}, and future work with {future work}.
    

**Example Opening (to mimic):**

> “Plastics have become integral to modern life, permeating nearly every aspect of our daily routines. … Among the various types, polypropylene stands out for its chemical resistance, high melting point, and mechanical robustness.”

### **🔹 LLM PROMPT TEMPLATE ─ “Comprehensive System‑Analysis Report”**

  

**Context & Tone**

You are an experienced researcher writing for a doctoral comprehensive examination audience.
Your prose should be _scholarly yet engaging_, weaving clear transitions and occasional first‑person‑plural (“we”) phrasing to create a subtle human touch. Cite sources in Vancouver‑style numbers 1 as you go.


**Assignment**

Produce a **≈9,000‑word** report titled:

> **System Analysis of [BRIEF TITLE OF NEW RESEARCH TOPIC]**

  

Follow **exactly** the numbered section scheme below (mirrors the exemplar’s architecture). Use the same decimal heading hierarchy, write in complete flowing sentences (avoid bare bullet points), and embed at least three Figure placeholders where appropriate (“Figure 1: …”). Where quantitative tables are useful, include them in minimal, clean Markdown.

---

#### **1.0 – Overview**
- Open with a 250–300 word narrative that grounds readers in the real‑world importance of **[NEW RESEARCH TOPIC]**.
- End the section by signalling the specific knowledge gaps your work will address.
    
#### **2.0 – Goals and Objectives**
- State the overarching goal in one precise paragraph.
- Enumerate **three Aims** (Aim 1, Aim 2, Aim 3) with a one‑sentence descriptor each, then articulate 2‑3 probing research questions that cut across the aims.
    
#### **3.0 – Research Background**

Provide two tightly argued subsections (~1,200 words total) that echo the exemplar’s balance of economic and environmental framing:
- **3.1 [Sub‑area A] background**
- **3.2 [Sub‑area B] background**
    
Blend literature synthesis with data‑driven insights, ending each subsection with a concise knowledge‑gap statement.

#### **4.0 – Proposed Research, Methods, and Results**

For **each Aim**, create two numbered **Tasks** (Task x.y) and treat them in subsections that mirror the exemplar’s depth:
- **4.1 Aim 1: [Title]**
    - **4.1.1 Task 1.1:** label with {completed}/{ongoing}/{future work}. Describe methods (software, models), key assumptions, and current outcomes (~400 words).
    - **4.1.2 Task 1.2:** repeat structure; include quantitative results, sensitivity analyses, and a brief discussion.
        
- **4.2 Aim 2: …**
    - … _(follow same pattern)_
        
- **4.3 Aim 3: …**
    
Throughout §4:
- Reference equations, model parameters, or kinetic schemes as fits the topic.
- Insert **Figure placeholders** for flowsheets, GIS maps, or trade‑off frontiers (e.g., “Figure 3: Pareto surface of NPV vs. GHG”).
- Conclude each Aim with a transitional paragraph linking findings to the next Aim.
    
#### **5.0 – Intellectual Merit**

In ~250 words, argue for the scientific novelty of your integrated framework (methodological advances, unprecedented coupling of models, etc.).

#### **6.0 – Broader Impact**
In ~250 words, discuss societal, policy, and industry relevance, echoing the exemplar’s forward‑looking optimism.

#### **7.0 – References**
Supply **≥35 distinct, real, citable sources** spanning peer‑reviewed journals, datasets, and technical standards. Number them in order of appearance.

**Style Reminders (learned from exemplar)**

- Maintain logical flow; avoid orphan bullet lists—convert lists into narrative sentences with embedded colons or semicolons.
- Use occasional parenthetical qualifiers “(see Figure 2)” to orient the reader.
- Transparently label task status: **{completed} / {ongoing} / {future work}**.
- Where uncertainty or limitations arise, acknowledge them candidly and suggest next steps.
- Keep section lengths proportional to those in the sample (biggest bulk in §4).
    
**Deliverable Format**

Return clean Markdown with numbered headings exactly as above. Figures should be caption placeholders; tables should be Markdown tables. Ensure citation numbers are bracketed and sequential.

### **➡️ Example of minimal placeholder substitution**

> **System Analysis of Electro‑Biochemical Ammonia Synthesis from Renewable Electricity**

> _Replace all_ NEW RESEARCH TOPIC _tokens accordingly; adjust background sub‑areas (e.g., techno‑economic feasibility, climate impacts) and software choices (e.g., Aspen, YOLOx)._
