## About:

Nelson Y. Dzade is a passionate educator and an interdisciplinary research scientist. He is an Assistant Professor and the Chair of the Undergraduate Energy Engineering Program in the John and Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering at Penn State. He is also the Co-Director of AESEDA – The Penn State Alliance for Education, Science, Engineering, and Design with Africa. He holds affiliate positions with several world-class interdisciplinary research-based centers of excellence at Penn State, including the EMS Energy Institute (EI), Materials Research Institute (MRI), the Institutes of Energy and the Environment (IEE), and the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS). Before joining Penn State, he was a U.K. Innovation Research Fellow and Independent Group Leader at the School of Chemistry, Cardiff University. He was also a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Department of Earth Sciences, Utrecht University, Netherlands.

Dzade is a strong advocate for the advancement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in Africa. He is particularly passionate about strengthening research and training capacity in sub-Saharan African Institutions of Higher Education. He has been involved in several collaborative research and training initiatives across Universities in Africa, including the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana, the University of Botswana (UB), the University of Namibia (UNAM), the University of Limpopo, South Africa, and the African University of Science and Technology, Nigeria, where he currently serves also as a Visiting Professor. Dzade actively mentors, inspires, and encourages young people (especially underrepresented minorities) to be lifelong learners (i.e., to always have a growth mindset and an innate curiosity about the world, where they constantly push themselves to acquire new skills and capabilities and discover more by way of new challenges, ideas, and experiences). He has also launched the Africa Network of Computational Materials Scholars (AFRINETCOMS) platform, bringing together computational materials scholars across Africa and the world at large with the goal of building capacity, knowledge sharing, training and support, coaching, and mentoring. He is also a regular speaker/instructor at the African School on Electronic Structure Methods and Applications – ASESMA. He is also a strong advocate for policies that invest in renewable energy, champion green, efficient manufacturing (circular economy), and uphold strong environmental protections.  

Research Projects

Dzade leads the Materials and Minerals Theory (MMT) Group, which sits on the interface of Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Machine Learning, Materials, and Minerals Science and Engineering. The MMT Group specializes in developing and applying advanced theoretical methods to unravel structure-property-performance relationships in solid-state materials. Often taking place in close collaboration with experiments, Dzade’s current research emphasizes the development of ab initio methods and harnessing the predictive capacity of first-principles calculations to gain a detailed understanding of the fundamental science needed to rationally design and engineer novel functional materials with unparalleled performance in several renewable energy technologies such as photovoltaics, heterogeneous catalysis, high-capacity batteries, and mineral processing and separation. The four main strands of research in the MMT Group are (i) the rational design of active and robust catalysts for green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide conversion to chemicals and fuels, (ii) unraveling the complex interfacial phenomena and charge carrier and mobile ion dynamic processes in solar cells and optoelectronic devices, (iii) the development of earth-abundant cathode materials for superior rechargeable battery chemistries capable of higher charge capacities and specific energy densities, and (iv) providing atomic-level insights into environmentally relevant reactions and geochemical processes occurring at mineral surfaces/interfaces, including crystal growth, adsorption reactions, mineral dissolution, extraction, and separation.

Title(s)
Assistant Professor of Energy Mineral Engineering

Olumide Ogunmodimu is an assistant professor in the Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering (EME) at Penn State University. He also holds co-funded faculty appointments with the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS) and the Materials Research Institute (MRI). He earned a master’s degree in energy studies and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Cape Town, South Africa, where his doctoral research focused on granular flow modeling in mineral processing.

Before joining Penn State, Ogunmodimu held postdoctoral research positions at the University of Cape Town and the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) at the University of Queensland, Australia. He also worked in the industry at Weir Minerals Australia, where he developed technical documentation for pumps, cyclones, and comminution equipment, supporting engineering design, equipment application, and process integration in mineral processing operations.

Ogunmodimu’s research spans the entire value chain of mineral processing, with a focus on comminution and classification, mechanical activation of minerals, filtration and separation, and bulk solids flow modeling. He combines rheological and electrochemical characterization of particulate systems with high-resolution experimental techniques such as Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) for granular flow visualization and model validation. He employs advanced computational tools, including the Discrete Element Method (DEM), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Method (FEM), and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), to simulate and optimize complex multiphase systems. His work integrates physical modeling with data science, particularly in creating machine learning-enabled digital twins for milling and classification units. These digital twins enhance real-time process monitoring and refinement of mineral liberation circuit performance, facilitating more efficient, predictive, and adaptive plant operation.

In the energy sector, Ogunmodimu explores sustainable applications of industrial waste. This involves repurposing metallurgical slags as cost-effective thermal energy storage (TES) materials in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems and valorizing coal refuse for use in pozzolanic cement production, thereby contributing to reduced emissions and innovation in the circular economy. He is affiliated with the Energy Institute (EI) and the Alliance for Education, Science, Engineering and Design with Africa (AESEDA), supporting global knowledge exchange and capacity building in science and engineering.

Ogunmodimu collaborates with a global network of institutions, including MINTEK South Africa, Fraunhofer ITWM Germany, University of South Australia, the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) at the University of Queensland, Australia, African University of Science and Technology (AUST) Nigeria, Moi University, Kenya, and Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), South Africa. Through the integration of computational modeling, nuclear imaging, machine learning, and sustainable materials engineering, Ogunmodimu’s research advances innovation at the intersection of mineral processing, energy systems, and data-driven industrial technologies.
