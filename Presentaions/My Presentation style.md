To do
- [>] Practice question based presentation style with Dr. Shi's meeting @due(2025-04-23) @started(2025-04-23)
- [ ] Write an article on this presentation style with my personal story and journey


Argumentative first presentation
	begin with a question
	Show results with your simulation
	
Assertive based presentation
Conclude with an assertion



Can we have a dynamic title?
	where we precede the slide with a question?
	We show our results?
	we dynamically change the title 
		new title must have a different color
	mover old questionnaire title to the bottom
		old question must be grayed out



I think a question based presentation will be more suitable to me
combined with pauses, slow talking, 
reflective moments.

goal is to generate a conversation ,

Use assetion based style for literature review and question based style for results presentation and discussion.
