The **NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm** was used to maximize **net present value (NPV) and exergy efficiency**.

The model was design using python.
QUASI-2d MODEL

**Key Findings ‚Äì Hydrogen vs. Power-Only Generation (05:17 - 06:16)**

- **Cogeneration of hydrogen and power improves net present value by at least 2.4 times compared to power-only systems.**
- **Exergy efficiency in cogeneration is 5-17% higher than power-only generation.**
- Hydrogen production benefits from its higher efficiency at low fuel use ratios, reducing energy losses.

Understanding the influence of decisign variables of the system.
Current density: effect on NPV EFF. 
increase in current density decrease in stack size, and consequently it's cost.
but it also reduces the efficiency of power conversion.
 Thus a low current density would favor higher efficiencies, while a high current density may benefitt revenues.
 **Impact of Design Variables (06:16 - 07:38)**

- Higher **current density** reduces fuel cell size and cost but lowers power conversion efficiency.
 - **Fuel use ratio** is higher in power-only generation but lower in hydrogen production to allow for hydrogen recovery.
- **Temperature and air ratio** affect methane reforming, which influences hydrogen availability.

**Capital Investment & Cost Trade-offs (08:11 - 09:03)**

- Hydrogen cogeneration **reduces fuel cell size and cost by 45%**, balancing out additional equipment costs.
- **Heat exchanger network costs are higher** for hydrogen production due to lower available high-temperature heat.

**Overall Conclusion & Implications (09:03 - 10:21)**

- **Hydrogen and electricity cogeneration improves NPV by 140-170% and exergy efficiency by 5-17%, with only a 5% increase in investment costs.**
- **Fuel cells suffer efficiency losses at high fuel use ratios**, making hydrogen enrichment and separation viable for efficiency gains (62-65%).
- The investment cost remains similar to power-only systems due to fuel cell size reduction.
