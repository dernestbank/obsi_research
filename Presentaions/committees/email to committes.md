Selection of PhD Committee Members for Comprehensive Exam and Thesis Defense

  

Dear Dr. Shi,

I am writing to inform you of my selected committee members for my comprehensive exam and thesis defense, following your recommendations and considering the alignment of their expertise with my research on green hydrogen production and optimization using PEM electrolyzers.

Selected Committee Members:

1. Dr. Bruce E. Logan
    Dr. Logan’s extensive research in renewable energy technologies, particularly in microbial electrolysis cells and hydrogen production, aligns closely with my focus on hydrogen generation. His work on developing sustainable energy solutions and his role as director of the Hydrogen Energy Center at Penn State would provide invaluable insights into the practical applications of my research.
    
2. Dr. Andrew Zydney
    Dr. Zydney’s  expertise on membrane processes will be valuable to my PEM electrolyser design and model. His insights into membrane technology could significantly enhance the understanding of the transport system and design optimization in my work.
    
3. Dr. Phillip E. Savage
    Dr. Savage’s experience in  catalysis  and system analysis such as concerning the conversion of biomass to renewable fuels, complements design and optimization aspect of my study. 

I believe that the collective expertise of these faculty members will provide a comprehensive perspective on both the fundamental and applied aspects of my research. I look forward to your feedback on this selection and any further recommendations you might have. Upon your approval I will proceed to send them an email.

Thank you for your continued guidance and support.


Best regards,

I am currently in the process of scheduling my comprehensive exam and would like to coordinate a date that aligns with your availability. Please let me know your preferred times, and I will do my best to accommodate your schedule.

Should you require additional information about my research or have any questions, I would be happy to provide further details or meet at your convenience.

Thank you for considering this invitation. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Warm regards,

**Subject:** Invitation to Serve on My PhD Committee – Green Hydrogen Production via PEM Electrolyzer Modeling

Dear Dr. Logan,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is  Ernest Boakye Danquah, and I am a 2nd year  graduate student in Chemical Engineering Department working under the supervision of Dr. Rui Shi (rms6987@psu.edu). I am writing to respectfully invite you to serve as a member of my PhD committee for my upcoming comprehensive exam/ Masters Defense Thesis and subsequent thesis work.

My research focuses on the technoeconomic analysis and optimization of green hydrogen production, specifically through the development of a bottom-up, physics-based model of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer system. The model includes detailed design of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), including the catalyst layers and proton exchange membrane, and integrates coupled electrochemical and transport analyses to enhance system efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

 Given your expertise in renewable hydrogen production systems and technologies, I believe your insights and feedback would greatly enhance the scientific rigor of my work and contribute meaningfully to the direction of my research.

If you are willing and available to serve on my committee, I will coordinate with Dr. Shi and the department to schedule the comprehensive exam at a time that works with your availability. I would also be happy to share a research summary and proposed timeline in advance for your review.

Please let me know if you would be open to serving in this role. I would be truly grateful for your support and mentorship during this critical phase of my doctoral journey.

Warm regards,
Ernest Boakye Danquah

Hello Dr. Shi,

About tomorrow’s meeting, I will recommend we cancel it so you can have as much time as you need for your meeting with Prof. Kyle. I will round up with my courses and research before the finals week. 

The only thing for discussion will be on the NSF icorps national program. Hafi and I met with Derek Gross yesterday. 
Apparently in order to proceed we need a team that consist of an Entrepreneurial lead, a Technical lead and a Industry mentor which all require a level of time commitment. 
We will like to  want your suggestion on us applying for the nationals for either fall or winter cohorts. 





Hello Dr. Shi,

  

Regarding tomorrow’s meeting, I propose that we cancel it to allow you ample time for your scheduled meeting with Professor Kyle. I will finalize my coursework and research prior to the commencement of finals week.

One thing of discussion pertains to the National Science Foundation (NSF) ICORPS National Program. Yesterday, Hafi and I met with Derek Gross.
We understand that to proceed with the program, a team must be assembled comprising an Entrepreneurial leader, a Technical leader, and an Industry mentor, each of whom requires a specified level of time commitment.

We would appreciate your guidance in determining whether we should submit an application for  the fall or winter cohorts.
