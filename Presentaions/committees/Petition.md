Dear Members of the Graduate Programs Committee,

I am writing to respectfully petition for continuation into the Ph.D. program in Chemical Engineering at Penn State, effective [Fall/Spring YEAR], following the successful defense of my master’s thesis on [Defense Date]. My thesis, titled _[Full Thesis Title]_, was completed under the supervision of [Dr. Advisor’s Full Name], and examined [one-sentence focus/novelty: e.g., “the electrochemical–systems integration of PEM electrolyzers with renewable energy for low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen production”].

Over the course of the M.S. program I have built the technical, scholarly, and professional foundation needed for doctoral work. Highlights include: completion of core graduate coursework with a GPA of [X.XX/4.00]; development and validation of a physics-based PEM electrolyzer model coupled with techno-economic and life-cycle assessment; and preparation of a manuscript for submission to [Target Journal(s)]. Portions of this work have been presented to [venue/class/group if applicable], and I am actively refining the results for publication and broader dissemination.

My proposed Ph.D. research will extend this trajectory by (i) deepening the electrochemical and transport modeling of PEM systems (with explicit treatment of ohmic, activation, and mass-transfer losses tied to materials and operating conditions), (ii) integrating grid-interactive and renewables-only supply scenarios to quantify system-level performance under uncertainty, and (iii) linking these technical findings to decision-relevant metrics—levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), environmental impacts, and investment performance—to inform durable, scalable deployment. This work aligns closely with departmental strengths in electrochemical engineering, separations and membranes, energy systems, and sustainability.

Subject to departmental approval, I intend to continue under the primary advisement of [Dr. Advisor’s Last Name] and to constitute a committee that brings together expertise in [membranes/electrochemistry/systems analysis]. I would be honored to include faculty such as [Prof. A], [Prof. B], and [Prof. C] given their complementary expertise and prior guidance on my M.S. research. I am prepared to follow all program procedures regarding the Ph.D. candidacy/comprehensive examination and to schedule that examination at the earliest time permitted by departmental policy. I also respectfully request that applicable M.S. coursework and research credits be counted toward the Ph.D. requirements as allowed by the Graduate Bulletin and department guidelines.

Enclosed/attached please find the following supporting materials for your review:

- One-page Ph.D. research plan and timeline (milestones for coursework, candidacy/comprehensive exam, publications, and proposal/defense).
- Thesis abstract and a brief summary of key results.
- Curriculum vitae and unofficial transcript.
- A letter of support from [Dr. Advisor’s Last Name], if the Committee finds it helpful.

Penn State’s Chemical Engineering program offers the exact scholarly environment and mentorship needed to complete this research at a high level and to contribute meaningful advances to clean-energy technologies. I am grateful for the training I have already received here and am eager to continue as a doctoral student.

Thank you for your consideration of my petition. I would be happy to provide any additional information the Committee may require.

Sincerely,
