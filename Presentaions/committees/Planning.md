Dear Jennie,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to let you know that my thesis defense date has been moved. It will no longer take place on July 17; the new proposed date and time are:

Friday, August 8th

Could you please assist me with booking a suitable room for that slot?

Thank you very much for your help! Please let me know if you need any additional details.
