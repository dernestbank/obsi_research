**1. Why did you choose this topic?**  
I selected “System Design and Technoeconomic Analysis of Green Hydrogen Production via PEM Electrolysis” because, although PEM electrolyzers offer high efficiency and operational flexibility under variable renewables, existing studies treat electrochemical design, economic evaluation, and energy-supply modeling in isolation. This siloing obscures key trade-offs between membrane/catalyst choices, electricity pricing, and capacity factors. My work addresses this gap by unifying physics-based stack modeling with an hourly-resolved techno-economic framework to inform cost-effective, scalable green hydrogen deployment .

---

**2. Briefly explain what your research project is all about.**  
My project develops and validates an integrated modeling framework that:

- **Electrochemical core:** Implements a lumped-parameter 0D/1D PEM electrolyzer model capturing activation, ohmic, and concentration overpotentials, membrane hydration, Faradaic efficiency, and gas crossover.
- **Dynamic energy coupling:** Ingests hourly PV, wind, and hybrid generation profiles (sourced from NREL) to simulate real-time power availability and price signals.
- **Techno-economic assessment:** Embeds the cell-level outputs (specific energy consumption, stack efficiency, and hydrogen output) into a discounted-cash-flow cost module following DOE’s H2A v3.2018 methodology to compute LCOH, NPV, and IRR over a 20-year horizon.  
    By linking these elements, the framework identifies principal cost drivers, optimal design parameters, and the most promising renewable-electrolyzer configurations for green hydrogen production .
    

---

**3. What is the scope of your research project?**

- **System boundary:** From water pretreatment through the PEM stack and gas-handling up to the plant fence (delivering ≥99.97 % purity hydrogen at 30 bar), excluding downstream compression, transport, and end use.
- **Functional unit & scales:** One kilogram of H₂ delivered; case studies at 1,500, 10,000, and 50,000 kg/day capacities to probe economies of scale.
- **Geographic/temporal context:** A representative U.S. inland site (Great Plains archetype) with grid-only, solar-PV only, and 50:50 PV–wind hybrid configurations modeled at hourly resolution over a 20-year plant life.
- **Metrics:** Technical (specific energy consumption, capacity factor) and economic (levelized cost of hydrogen, net present value, internal rate of return) .
    

---

**4. What is the significance of your study?**

- **Intellectual merit:** Introduces a rigorously coupled, multi-scale framework that bridges electrochemical stack design, system-level cost assessment, and dynamic renewable integration—unlike static or single-domain analyses .
    
- **Broader impact:**
    
    - Supplies site-specific LCOH and NPV maps to guide policymakers on tailored incentives (e.g., production tax credits, locational subsidies).
    - Demonstrates that distributed, mid-scale electrolyzers can achieve competitive hydrogen costs in remote or grid-constrained regions, fostering industrial decarbonization and local job creation.
    - Informs grid operators on the value of electrolyzers as flexible loads and ancillary-service providers, aiding high-renewables grid stability .
        

---

**5. What are your research variables?**

- **Decision (design) variables:**
    - Membrane thickness, catalyst layer loadings, ionomer content, cell operating temperature and current-density setpoints.
    - Mechanical constraints (e.g., minimum membrane thickness to withstand ΔP, Faradaic efficiency ≥99 %).
        
- **Input (economic/energy) parameters:**
    - Electricity tariff ($/kWh), uninstalled CAPEX ($/kW), fixed O&M, water cost, co-product O₂ selling price.
        
- **Output (performance/economic) metrics:**
    - Specific energy consumption (kWh/kg H₂), capacity factor (%), levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH, $/kg), net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) .
        

---

**6. What research methodology did you use?**

- **Electrochemical modeling:** Developed a 0D/1D PEM stack model incorporating reversible and thermoneutral voltages, Butler–Volmer kinetics for activation overpotentials, ohmic and concentration losses, and Faradaic efficiency; validated against experimental polarization data (RMSE = 32 mV, R² = 0.897).
    
- **Energy system design:** Coupled hourly PV, wind, and hybrid generation profiles with grid imports/exports using NREL data to determine dynamic capacity factors and weighted electricity prices.
    
- **Techno-economic analysis:** Built a discounted-cash-flow module per DOE H2A v3.2018 (customized learning-curve exponents, installation factors, MACRS depreciation) to calculate LCOH, NPV, and IRR over 20 years.
    
- **Sensitivity & uncertainty:** Performed univariate (tornado diagrams) and multivariate/Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the influence and probabilistic risk of key inputs on LCOH and NPV.
    
- **Optimization (future work):** Outlined a multi-objective NSGA-II workflow to minimize specific energy consumption and CAPEX while maximizing efficiency under operational constraints .


**8. Why did you use that research methodology?**  
We adopted an integrated, multi-scale modeling methodology because it uniquely couples detailed electrochemical stack behavior with system-level techno-economic analysis and dynamic renewable energy inputs. By embedding a validated 0D/1D PEM electrolyzer model within an hourly-resolved discounted-cash-flow framework, we capture key trade-offs between design variables (e.g., membrane thickness, catalyst loading), fluctuating electricity prices, and capacity factors—insights that siloed or static analyses cannot reveal . This approach ensures our results are both physically grounded and economically relevant for real-world deployment scenarios.

---

**9. What limitations did you encounter?**

- **Production-only scope:** We excluded downstream costs (compression, storage, transport), which can add 20–30 % to total supply-chain expenses .

- **Simplified dispatch logic:** Our model assumes instantaneous power allocation and perfect foresight, omitting grid-connection constraints, ramp-rate limits, and forecasting errors that occur in practice .
    
- **Static financial assumptions:** Fixed WACC, tax rates, and offtake prices over 20 years ignore market volatility and policy changes (e.g., carbon pricing, incentive shifts) .
    
- **Simplified degradation:** We abstract detailed water-chemistry dynamics, membrane fouling, and evolving catalyst degradation modes, which may affect long-term maintenance and stack lifetime .
    
- **Site specificity:** Renewable profiles are based on a representative inland U.S. site; results may not generalize to coastal, arid, or high-latitude regions without recalibration .
    

---

**10. What source of data was employed for the research?**  
All data were **secondary**:

- **Electrochemical validation:** Polarization and efficiency data from peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Scheepers et al.).
    
- **Renewable profiles:** Hourly solar and wind time series from NREL’s datasets .
    
- **Cost parameters:** DOE H2A v3.2018 defaults for CAPEX/OPEX, adjusted with recent vendor and NREL manufacturing reports.
    
- **Financial inputs:** Publicly available WACC, tax, and incentive rates from DOE and federal sources.
    

No primary data (e.g., questionnaires or interviews) were collected.

---

**11. Supporting your findings, what areas will you suggest for future research?**  
Based on our sensitivity and techno-economic insights, future work should explore:

- **Multi-objective optimization** of PEM designs (minimizing CAPEX and SEC while maximizing efficiency) using algorithms like NSGA-II .
    
- **Material substitution studies**, integrating advanced membrane chemistries and non-precious catalysts into the model to quantify cost-performance trade-offs.
    
- **Dynamic renewable-electrolyzer optimization**, jointly sizing electrolyzer, storage, and energy mix under real-time market signals.
    
- **Geospatial, hourly LCOH mapping** with overlays for policy incentives and emissions intensity to guide site selection.
    
- **Detailed degradation modeling**, incorporating water-chemistry, fouling, and transient operation effects on long-term stack performance.
    

---

**12. How would you relate your findings to existing theory on the study?**  
Our results affirm and extend core electrochemical and economic theories:

- **Electrochemical kinetics:** The observed overpotential–current density trade-offs follow Butler–Volmer predictions, demonstrating how increased current densities raise activation and concentration losses as theory suggests .
    
- **Scale-economies theory:** Diminishing LCOH returns beyond ~10,000 kg/day capacity mirror classical cost-scaling laws, where fixed-capital benefits taper as variable electricity costs dominate .
    
- **TEA frameworks:** Embedding H2A’s discounted-cash-flow approach confirms that electricity price and uninstalled CAPEX are the dominant drivers of LCOH—consistent with prior H2A-based studies—and quantifies these dependencies under dynamic, high-resolution renewable scenarios .


**1. Gap in knowledge and justification**  
While numerous studies evaluate PEM electrolyzer materials, techno-economic analyses (TEA), or renewable integration separately, **very few have systematically connected material-level design choices to their economic and technical outcomes at hourly resolution**. This siloing obscures which membrane or catalyst improvements truly drive cost-effective performance when scaled to commercial module sizes .

**2. Contribution to knowledge**  
This thesis delivers an **integrated, multi-scale framework** that:

- **Couples a validated 0D/1D PEM stack model** (capturing activation, ohmic, concentration overpotentials, membrane hydration, Faradaic efficiency, and gas crossover)
    
- **Embeds these cell-level outputs into a modular TEA** (calculating LCOH, NPV, IRR over a 20-year horizon per DOE H2A v3.2018)
    
- **Overlays an hourly-resolved energy-supply layer** (PV, wind, hybrid, grid) to simulate real-world dispatch and price signals
    

By merging electrochemical physics, economics, and dynamic renewable modeling, the work uncovers trade-offs and cost drivers that one-dimensional analyses miss—identifying, for example, that electricity price and uninstalled CAPEX account for over 80 % of NPV variability in a 10,000 kg/day system .

**3. If repeating the work, what would you do differently?**

- **Include downstream supply-chain costs** (compression, storage, transport), which can add 20–30 % to total delivered cost .
    
- **Incorporate realistic dispatch constraints**, such as ramp-rate limits, imperfect forecasting, and ancillary-service obligations.
    
- **Model time-varying financial parameters**, e.g., adjustable WACC, carbon pricing, and policy incentives over the project life.
    
- **Capture detailed degradation pathways**, including water-chemistry effects, membrane fouling, and catalyst dissolution under variable operation.
    
- **Expand geographic scope**, calibrating to coastal, arid, and high-latitude renewable profiles beyond a single inland site.
    

**4. Closest related literature and key difference**  
The **Colella et al. (2014) H2A study** comparing “forecourt” (1,500 kg/day) and “central” (50,000 kg/day) PEM electrolysis cases is perhaps the most similar. However, it uses a **static** discounted-cash-flow model without detailed cell-level kinetics or dynamic renewable dispatch. By contrast, **this thesis integrates** a physics-based electrolyzer model and **hourly-resolved** renewable profiles to reveal how design choices interact with intermittency .

**5. Current trends in the research area**

- **Advanced MEA materials**: Development of fully hydrocarbon and composite membranes and non-precious catalysts to reduce crossover and improve durability .
    
- **Additive manufacturing**: 3D-printed flow plates and integrated electrolyzer cells for cost-effective, modular fabrication .
    
- **Open-source, dynamic TEA tools**: Movement toward frameworks that couple detailed electrolyzer models with real-time renewable inputs, enabling geospatial LCOH mapping and policy analysis.
    
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Use of algorithms (e.g., NSGA-II) to jointly minimize CAPEX and specific energy consumption while maximizing efficiency under realistic constraints.

**1. Can you summarize your key findings in just a few sentences?**  
We developed and validated an integrated, multi-scale framework linking a physics-based PEM electrolyzer model with an hourly-resolved techno-economic analysis. For a 10,000 kg/day plant at 333 K and 30 bar running on $0.07/kWh electricity, we found hydrogen can be produced at $7/kg with a 32 % IRR and $77 M NPV. Electricity price dominates LCOH sensitivity—each $0.04/kWh change shifts LCOH by up to $2/kg—while installed CAPEX is the next largest lever. Mid-scale systems (8,000–12,000 kg/day) paired with tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh hit the “sweet spot” for sub-$5/kg hydrogen .

---

**2. Why did you undertake this research?**  
Existing studies treat materials design, economic assessment, and renewable-integration separately, obscuring how membrane/catalyst choices translate into real-world costs under variable power. I aimed to bridge these silos with a unified, data-driven tool to pinpoint the true cost drivers and optimal configurations for green hydrogen deployment .

Push toward mid-scale (8–12 ton/day) PEM projects sited with tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh, prioritize stack and BoP CAPEX reductions to $500/kW, and focus R&D on cutting SEC to ≤45 kWh/kg—and secure long-term low-price PPAs to unlock sub-$5/kg hydrogen .

---

**8. What are the implications of what you have found to society in general?**  
Achieving competitive green hydrogen at scale can decarbonize steel, ammonia, and heavy transport, bolster energy security by leveraging domestic renewables, stabilize grids via demand-response flexibility, and create new manufacturing and operations jobs in clean-tech sectors .

---

**9. What are the most important papers related to your own research and how is yours different?**

- **Carmo et al. (2013)** provided a foundational PEM review but lacked system-level economics .
    
- **Debe et al. (2012)** furnished polarization data for model validation; we matched it within 32 mV RMSE .
    
- **James et al. (2013)** offered static H2A TEA case-studies; we extend this by coupling cell-level physics with hourly renewable dispatch .
    

My thesis uniquely integrates electrochemical kinetics, discounted-cash-flow TEA, and real-time energy modeling into one cohesive framework.

---

**10. What other developments have been made in your field recently?**

- **Additive manufacturing** of flow plates and fully printed electrolyzer cells for cost-effective modular builds .
    
- **Advanced MEA materials**, including composite and hydrocarbon membranes, aiming to cut degradation and material costs.

- **Multi-objective optimization** (e.g., NSGA-II) frameworks co-optimizing CAPEX and SEC under real-world constraints.
    

---

**11. Why did you select the research methodology that you used?**  
A coupled, multi-scale approach was necessary to reveal the interactions between electrolyzer physics, fluctuating power costs, and financial metrics. Embedding a validated 0D/1D stack model within an hourly-resolved DCF framework ensures our conclusions are both technically robust and economically actionable—insights unattainable by siloed, static analyses .


**11. In hindsight, should you have used a different methodology?**  
The integrated 0D/1D electrochemical–hourly-resolved DCF framework was well suited to link cell-level physics with system-level economics. However, incorporating **imperfect-foresight dispatch modeling** (rather than perfect hourly allocation) and **detailed degradation sub-models** from the start would have added realism, especially under variable renewables .

**12. Would you have discovered anything else with a different approach?**  
Yes. A methodology that embeds **continuous degradation kinetics** could have revealed how performance losses gradually raise LCOH over a plant’s lifetime. Likewise, a **market-simulation approach** might have quantified revenue streams from ancillary-service provision and uncovered new value-stacking opportunities.

**13. What are the ethical implications of your work and how should they be dealt with?**

- **Water use & local impacts:** Large-scale PEM electrolysis consumes ∼9 kg water per kg H₂; in water-stressed regions, this raises equity concerns. Mitigation: prioritize **non-potable or recycled water**, and conduct **site-specific water-impact assessments**.
    
- **Resource mining & disposal:** Catalyst and membrane manufacture involve critical raw materials (e.g., Pt, Nafion). Ethical sourcing policies and **end-of-life recycling programs** are needed to minimize environmental footprints.
    
- **Community engagement:** Deployment in remote or disadvantaged areas requires **inclusive stakeholder consultation** to ensure benefits (e.g., jobs, resilience) are equitably distributed.
    

**14. How do you know that your findings are right?**

- **Model validation:** The polarization curve matched experimental data (RMSE ≈ 32 mV, R² ≈ 0.897) from Debe et al. 2012 .
    
- **Robustness checks:** Univariate tornado and multivariate/Monte Carlo analyses confirmed that electricity price and CAPEX dominate LCOH uncertainty, ensuring key trends are insensitive to secondary inputs .
    

**15. What is the weakest part of your work?**  
Excluding **downstream compression, storage, and transport** costs likely underestimates delivered hydrogen expenses by 20–30 % and omits potential bottlenecks in the supply chain .

**16. What would you suggest as future research and why?**  
Building on Section 5.5, key directions include:

1. **Multi-objective optimization** of CAPEX vs. SEC vs. efficiency under realistic grid constraints.
    
2. **Geospatial, hourly-resolved LCOH mapping** with emissions and policy layers to guide siting.
    
3. **Detailed degradation and water-chemistry modeling** to forecast maintenance cycles and water-quality impacts.  
    These address the primary limitations and refine cost-performance targets .
    

**17. If you could start over, what would you have done differently?**

- **Pilot testing:** Acquire primary performance and degradation data from a small-scale PEM unit.
    
- **Stakeholder integration:** Engage with grid operators and local water authorities early to model real dispatch rules and water sourcing.
    
- **Dynamic financing:** Incorporate time-varying WACC and potential carbon pricing trajectories into the DCF.
    

**18. What advice would you give to yourself at the start of your research?**  
“**Validate early, iterate often**”: begin with small-scale experiments to ground your model; then layer in economics and renewables. And “**think systems**” by involving policy and community stakeholders to ensure your assumptions reflect real-world constraints.

**19. Do you intend to publish any of your research? If so, where?**  
Yes. Suitable outlets include:

- **International Journal of Hydrogen Energy** (core PEM electrolysis and TEA audience)
    
- **Applied Energy** or **Energy Conversion and Management** (for integrated system-level studies)
    
- **Journal of Cleaner Production** (to emphasize sustainability and ethical implications)  
    Additionally, I plan to present at the **Electrochemical Society** and **World Hydrogen Leaders** conferences.


20. In a single sentence please summarize your paper.  
    This thesis presents an integrated, physics-informed techno-economic framework that couples a validated 0D/1D PEM electrolyzer model with hourly-resolved renewable energy profiles and a discounted-cash-flow analysis to identify cost drivers and optimal configurations for green hydrogen production at scale .
    
21. What is the singular idea on which your paper is based?  
    That linking detailed electrochemical design parameters directly to dynamic energy inputs and economics reveals actionable insights—and cost drivers—missed by siloed or static analyses .
    
22. Why is the issue that you have chosen worthy of your thesis?  
    Because green hydrogen’s viability hinges on driving down its intrinsic production cost—where membrane/catalyst choices, scale economies, and power intermittency interact—and no existing study has holistically quantified these interdependencies at hourly resolution .

    By bridging electrochemical design, renewable integration, and techno-economic analysis into one rigorous framework, it fills a critical gap, enabling holistic cost–performance optimization and guiding both R&D and policy toward economically viable green hydrogen deployment .


**31. Summary of key findings**  
Our integrated framework reveals that electricity price and uninstalled CAPEX are the dominant drivers of hydrogen cost, with each $0.09/kWh tariff deviation impacting over 80 % of NPV for a 10 000 kg/day plant; mid-scale systems (≈8 000–12 000 kg/day) paired with tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh can achieve sub-$5/kg hydrogen when specific energy consumption is ≤45 kWh/kg and installed cost is ≤$500/kW .

---

**32. Background research conducted**  
I performed a comprehensive literature review covering:

- The global hydrogen economy and policy drivers (Chapter 2.1)
    
- PEM electrolyzer materials, MEA structures, catalysts, and degradation (Chapter 2.2)
    
- Existing techno-economic frameworks (H2A, HySupply, TechEST) and renewable-integration studies (Chapter 2.3) .
    

---

**33. Limitations faced while writing**  
Key study limitations (which also constrained the narrative scope) include:

- Excluding downstream compression, storage, and transport costs (which can add 20–30 % to total LCOH)
    
- Assuming perfect foresight and ideal dispatch logic, omitting real-world grid constraints and forecast errors
    
- Using static financial parameters (fixed WACC, tax rates, incentives) over 20 years
    
- Abstracting detailed degradation and water-chemistry dynamics
    
- Basing renewable profiles on a single inland U.S. site, limiting geographic generalizability .
    

---

**34. Rationale for chosen methodology and “sample”**  
I adopted a coupled 0D/1D electrochemical + hourly-resolved DCF approach because it uniquely links stack-level physics with system-level economics under variable renewables. The “sample” of case studies—1 500, 10 000, and 50 000 kg/day capacities—was selected to bracket distributed, mid-scale, and central production scales commonly used in DOE H2A analyses, enabling clear insights into economies of scale .

---

**35. Additions if asked to expand the study**  
To enrich the analysis I would include:

- Downstream supply-chain modeling (compression, storage, transport)
    
- Realistic dispatch constraints and imperfect foresight in grid interactions
    
- Time-varying financial scenarios (carbon pricing, incentive shifts)
    
- Detailed degradation sub-models (water-chemistry, membrane fouling)
    
- A broader set of geographic renewable profiles for coastal, arid, and high-latitude sites .
    

---

**36. Recommendations of the study**

- Target mid-scale (8–12 t/day) PEM projects with tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh
    
- Pursue CAPEX reductions to ≤$500/kW and SEC to ≤45 kWh/kg
    
- Secure long-term low-price PPAs to unlock sub-$5/kg hydrogen
    
- Focus R&D on durable, non-precious-metal catalysts and advanced membranes to extend stack lifetimes and lower material costs .
    

---

**37. Who formed the “sample” and (non-applicability of age groups)**  
No human participants or age cohorts were involved; my “sample” comprises three plant-capacity scenarios chosen to represent the spectrum of distributed, mid-scale, and centralized PEM electrolysis deployments .

---

**38. Hypothesis formulation**  
I hypothesized that **integrating detailed PEM electrolyzer physics with dynamic renewable energy inputs and DCF-based TEA** would uncover cost-performance trade-offs missed by siloed or static models; this was formalized in Research Question 1: “What are the principal techno-economic cost drivers…and how do these vary with scale, materials, and operating conditions?” .

---

**39. If given a chance to do something different**  
I would have integrated **imperfection-foresight dispatch models**, incorporated **primary experimental degradation data** from a pilot PEM unit, and engaged stakeholders (grid operators, water authorities) early to ground assumptions in operational realities .

---

**40. Limitations encountered with “samples”**  
The renewable resource “sample” (inland U.S. profiles) may not capture coastal or high-latitude variability, and assuming uniform policies and incentives overlooks site-specific regulatory changes that can materially affect economics .


**41. How did you relate your study to the existing theories?**  
We grounded our electrochemical model in **Butler–Volmer kinetics** and thermodynamics (reversible and thermoneutral voltages) and validated it against prior experimental polarization studies, while anchoring our economic module in the DOE’s H2A discounted-cash-flow framework—thereby mapping theory from reaction kinetics and financial analysis directly onto a cohesive, hourly-resolved system model .

---

**42. What is the future scope of this study?**  
Future work includes **multi-objective optimization** of stack design (minimizing SEC and CAPEX, maximizing durability), **material-substitution sensitivity** with advanced membranes and catalysts, **dynamic dispatch modeling** under imperfect foresight, and **geospatial, hourly LCOH mapping** with policy and emissions overlays to guide site selection .

---

**43. What do you plan to do with your work after you have completed your degree?**  
I intend to **publish** the integrated framework in the _International Journal of Hydrogen Energy_, open-source the Python tool for community use, and collaborate with industry partners to pilot mid-scale PEM installations leveraging our cost-performance targets.

Yes—our **polarization curve** matched literature data with RMSE ≈ 32 mV (R² ≈ 0.897), and we conducted **univariate and Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses** to confirm that electricity price and CAPEX dominate LCOH uncertainty .

---

**47. How would you improve your work?**  
By incorporating **realistic grid-connection constraints** (ramp rates, imperfect foresight), **time-varying financial parameters** (e.g., carbon pricing), and **primary degradation data** from pilot electrolyzer testing to refine lifetime and maintenance schedules .

---

**48. In a few sentences, can you tell us what your study is all about?**  
This thesis presents a **coupled, multi-scale framework** that integrates a validated 0D/1D PEM electrolyzer model with hourly renewable-energy profiles and a 20-year discounted-cash-flow TEA to identify the key cost drivers, optimal design parameters, and scale thresholds for achieving sub-$5/kg green hydrogen .

Key limitations include excluding downstream compression/storage costs, assuming perfect foresight in dispatch, using static financial parameters over 20 years, abstracting detailed degradation pathways, and relying on a single inland U.S. renewable profile .

---

**55. What are your findings?**  
Electricity tariff and CAPEX dominate hydrogen cost—each $0.01/kWh change shifts LCOH by ≈$0.50/kg—and mid-scale plants (8–12 t/day) with tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh, SEC ≤45 kWh/kg, and CAPEX ≤$500/kW can achieve sub-$5/kg hydrogen .

---

**54. What sampling technique did you employ?**  
Rather than human‐subject sampling, I used **Monte Carlo sampling** over key input distributions (electricity price, CAPEX, degradation rates) to quantify probabilistic uncertainty in LCOH and NPV .

---

**55. Why did you choose this method?**  
Monte Carlo sampling captures the joint variability and risk of multiple financial and technical inputs, ensuring robust, probabilistic insight into cost drivers beyond deterministic “best‐guess” scenarios .

---

**56. Based on your findings what are your recommendations?**  
Focus on mid-scale PEM projects (8–12 t/day) sited with long-term PPAs at ≤$0.05/kWh, drive R&D to reduce SEC to ≤45 kWh/kg and installed CAPEX to ≤$500/kW, and develop policy incentives (e.g., production tax credits) keyed to those cost targets .

---

**57. Based on your findings what areas will you suggest for future research?**  
I recommend multi-objective optimization of CAPEX vs. SEC vs. durability, dynamic dispatch modeling under imperfect foresight, geospatial hourly LCOH mapping with policy overlays, and detailed degradation/water-chemistry submodels to refine lifetime cost forecasts .

---

**58. How can your research study be put into practice?**  
Developers and policymakers can apply the open-source Python tool to evaluate site-specific hydrogen plants—testing renewable mixes, tariffs, and design parameters—to inform investment decisions, incentive structures, and R&D roadmaps toward cost-competitive deployment .

---

**59. How would you summarize your study to a practitioner in a few sentences?**  
This thesis delivers a turnkey, data-driven model that marries PEM electrolyzer kinetics with real-time renewable pricing and DCF economics—letting users rapidly assess how design choices and power contracts drive hydrogen cost, and identify configurations yielding sub-$5/kg H₂ .

---

**60. What would you change if you were to conduct the study again?**  
I would incorporate imperfect-foresight dispatch rules, gather primary degradation data from a pilot PEM unit, include downstream supply-chain costs, and model time-varying financial parameters (e.g., carbon pricing trajectories) to enhance realism .



**61. What is your measurement instrument?**  
No physical instruments were used; instead, the primary “instrument” was a computational modeling framework implemented in Python that couples a validated 0D/1D PEM electrolyzer model (benchmarked against experimental polarization curves) with an hourly-resolved renewable energy submodel and a DOE H2A-based discounted-cash-flow TEA module .

---

**62. What are your research variables?**

- **Design (decision) variables:** membrane thickness, catalyst layer loading, ionomer content, cell operating temperature and current-density setpoints.
    
- **Input parameters:** electricity tariff ($/kWh), uninstalled CAPEX ($/kW), fixed O&M, water cost, O₂ credit.
    
- **Output metrics:** specific energy consumption (kWh/kg H₂), capacity factor (%), levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH, $/kg), net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) .
    

---

**63. What are your research questions?**

1. What are the principal techno-economic cost drivers in PEM electrolyzer hydrogen production, and how do they vary with plant scale, material selection, and operating conditions?
    
2. How do design variables (e.g., membrane thickness, catalyst loading, operating temperature) affect energy efficiency, Faradaic performance, and stack durability—and how do these trade-offs translate into changes in LCOH and NPV?
    
3. What is the impact of different renewable supply configurations (PV, wind, hybrid, grid-interactive) on hydrogen cost and capacity factor when modeled hourly for specific locations? .
    

---

**64. What do you plan to do with your research project after graduation?**  
I intend to publish the integrated framework in peer-reviewed journals such as _International Journal of Hydrogen Energy_ and _Applied Energy_, open-source the Python code for community use, and collaborate with industry partners to pilot mid-scale PEM electrolyzer installations that leverage the identified cost-performance targets.

---

**65. What source of data was employed for the study?**  
All data were secondary:

- **Electrochemical validation:** Polarization curves and overpotential breakdowns from Debe et al. (2012).
    
- **Renewable profiles:** Hourly PV and wind time series from NREL datasets.
    
- **Cost parameters:** DOE H2A v3.2018 defaults for CAPEX/OPEX, adjusted with recent vendor and NREL manufacturing reports.
    
- **Financial inputs:** Publicly available WACC, tax, and incentive rates from DOE and federal publications .

- **Financial analysis:** DOE H2A discounted-cash-flow methodology for LCOH, NPV, and IRR .
    

---

**67. How would you relate your findings to existing theories on the study?**  
Our overpotential–current-density trade-offs follow Butler–Volmer predictions, with activation and ohmic losses scaling as theory suggests. The observed LCOH plateau beyond ~10,000 kg/day reflects classical cost-scaling laws, where fixed-capital benefits diminish as variable electricity costs dominate .

---

**68. What recommendations do you have for future research?**

- **Multi-objective optimization** of PEM design (CAPEX vs. SEC vs. durability).

The creation of an **open-source, multi-scale framework** that unifies physics-based PEM stack modeling, hourly-resolved renewable dispatch, and modular techno-economic analysis—addressing a literature gap where these domains were previously siloed .

---

**70. Which propositions or findings would you say are distinctively your own?**

- Demonstrating that **electricity tariff and uninstalled electrolyzer CAPEX** jointly account for over 80 % of NPV variability in a 10,000 kg/day plant.
    
- Identifying a **mid-scale sweet spot** (8,000–12,000 kg/day at tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh and SEC ≤45 kWh/kg) for achieving sub-$5/kg hydrogen.
    
- Quantifying how **LCOH contours steepen** dramatically once power prices exceed $0.15/kWh—insights only possible through our integrated, hourly-resolved approach .


**71. Advancing the literature**  
By delivering the first open-source, multi-scale framework that unifies detailed 0D/1D electrochemical modeling, hourly-resolved renewable dispatch, and discounted-cash-flow TEA, this work moves beyond siloed or static analyses and provides a cohesive tool for cost-performance optimization under real-world intermittency .

---

**72. Bottom-line conclusions and innovation**

- **Conclusions:** Electricity price and uninstalled electrolyzer CAPEX jointly drive over 80 % of NPV variability; mid-scale plants (8–12 t/day) at tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh and SEC ≤45 kWh/kg can reach sub-$5/kg hydrogen with IRRs >35 % .
    
- **Innovation/value:** Quantifies how dynamic interplay between stack design, scale, and power costs shapes LCOH contours—insights unattainable from prior static TEAs or standalone electrochemical studies. It tells us precisely which technical and financial levers unlock competitive green hydrogen .
    

---

**73. Choosing the topic**  
I selected “integrated, physics-informed TEA of PEM electrolysis” after identifying that existing studies either focused narrowly on MEA materials or treated cost analyses statically, leaving a critical gap in understanding cost drivers under variable renewables .

---

**74. First interest**  
My initial fascination sprang from seeing the promise of green hydrogen to decarbonize heavy industry and the conspicuous absence of tools that link detailed cell-level behavior with system-scale economics under real-time power variability .

---

**75. Topic choice in retrospect**  
Yes—I would choose it again. The question of how to drive down hydrogen costs remains urgent, and the integrated approach continues to yield actionable insights for R&D, policy, and investment .

---

**76. Evolution of research focus**  
The work began with a broad survey of hydrogen pathways and policy drivers (Chapter 2.1), then narrowed to PEM design fundamentals (Chapter 2.2), before converging on the integration of those models into a dynamic TEA framework (Chapters 3–5) .

---

**77. Defining the final topic**  
I framed the final topic to fill the identified literature gap—systematically coupling validated electrochemical kinetics, renewable intermittency, and financial modeling—to deliver a tool that speaks directly to the needs of researchers, developers, and policymakers .

---

**78. Difficulties and their influence**  
Key challenges included balancing model fidelity against computational tractability and scoping the analysis to production-only boundaries. These drove the decision to exclude downstream compression/storage, focus on three representative capacities, and assume perfect foresight in dispatch, ensuring clarity and reproducibility .

---

**79. Determining scope**  
I established clear system boundaries—from water pretreatment through the PEM stack to plant-fence hydrogen delivery—and selected three capacity “samples” (1 500, 10 000, 50 000 kg/day) to probe scale economies while holding out downstream and end-use costs .

---

**80. In-scope vs. out-of-scope trade-offs**  
The main issue was whether to include compression, storage, and transport—which would have broadened applicability but added complexity and obscured core electrochemical-economic interactions. I limited scope to production-site economics to deliver sharper, more focused insights .


**61. What is your measurement instrument?**  
No physical instrument was used. Instead, the primary “measurement instrument” is a **computational modeling framework** implemented in Python that couples a validated 0D/1D PEM electrolyzer model (capturing overpotentials, Faradaic efficiency, and gas crossover) with an hourly‐resolved DCF cost module following DOE H2A v3.2018 .

---

**64. What do you plan to do with your research project after graduation?**  
I intend to **publish** the framework in _International Journal of Hydrogen Energy_ or _Applied Energy_, **open‐source** the Python code for community use, and **collaborate** with industry partners to pilot mid‐scale PEM installations guided by our cost‐performance targets.

---

**65. What source of data was employed for the study?**  
All inputs are **secondary**:

- **Electrochemical validation:** polarization data from Debe et al. (2012), yielding an RMSE of ~32 mV.
    
- **Renewable profiles:** hourly PV and wind time series from NREL datasets.
    
- **Cost parameters:** DOE H2A v3.2018 defaults (CAPEX/OPEX), adjusted with recent vendor and NREL manufacturing reports .
    

---

**66. What theories or theoretical framework is your study based on?**

- **Electrochemical kinetics:** Butler–Volmer relations and Nernst/thermoneutral voltage theory.
    
- **Scale‐economies theory:** capital‐cost scaling laws for stack and BoP.
    
- **Financial analysis:** DOE H2A discounted‐cash‐flow methodology for LCOH, NPV, and IRR .
    

---

**67. How would you relate your findings to existing theories on the study?**  
Our overpotential–current‐density trade‐offs follow Butler–Volmer predictions, and the **LCOH plateau beyond ~10 000 kg/day** reflects classical cost‐scaling laws—where fixed‐capital benefits taper as electricity costs dominate .

---

---

**69. What are the most original (or value‐added) parts of your thesis?**  
The creation of an **open‐source, multi‐scale framework** that unifies physics‐based PEM stack modeling, hourly‐resolved renewable dispatch, and modular TEA—filling a literature gap where these domains were previously siloed .

---

**70. Which propositions or findings would you say are distinctively your own?**

- Demonstrating that **electricity tariff and uninstalled CAPEX** jointly account for over 80 % of NPV variability in a 10 000 kg/day plant.
    
- Identifying a **mid-scale “sweet spot”** (8 000–12 000 kg/day at tariffs ≤$0.05/kWh and SEC ≤45 kWh/kg) to achieve sub-$5/kg hydrogen.
    
- Quantifying how **LCOH contours steepen** dramatically when power prices exceed $0.15/kWh—insights possible only through our integrated, hourly‐resolved approach .



**91. How do your findings fit with or contradict the rest of the literature in this field?**  
Our results align with established techno-economic analyses (e.g., H2A studies) that identify electricity price and capital cost as the dominant levers on hydrogen cost. However, by coupling detailed PEM electrochemical modeling with hourly-resolved renewable profiles, we reveal **how** design choices (membrane thickness, catalyst loading) interact with power intermittency—an interaction that static TEAs and standalone electrochemical studies do not capture .

---

**92. How do you explain differences between your work and that of other authors?**  
Prior H2A-based studies (e.g., Colella et al. 2014) used static capacity-factor assumptions and treated stack performance as an input. In contrast, our framework **derives** capacity factors and specific energy consumption dynamically from first-principles electrochemistry and real-time renewable data, thus explaining why our LCOH contours shift more steeply with tariff changes than in static models .

---

**93. If you were to perform this study again, do you think you would find the same results?**  
Yes. While absolute LCOH values would adjust to updated cost or resource data, the **relative** sensitivities—electricity price and uninstalled CAPEX dominating NPV variability, and the mid-scale “sweet spot” for sub-$5/kg hydrogen—are rooted in fundamental cost-scaling and electrochemical trade-offs and would persist .

---

**94. What are the main implications or lessons of your research for the future development of work in this specific sub-field?**  
Researchers should adopt **integrated, dynamic frameworks** rather than siloed analyses, ensuring that material-level innovations are evaluated under the same intermittent power conditions they will face in deployment. Policy work must likewise consider hourly emissions and cost impacts, not annual averages .

---

**95. Are there any wider implications for other parts of the discipline?**  
Absolutely. Our multi-scale approach can be extended to other electrochemical systems—fuel cells, batteries, CO₂ electrolyzers—where performance, cost, and variable power inputs intersect. It also underscores the value of open-source, cross-domain tools for energy-system decarbonization.

---

**96. Do you have “next step” or follow-on research projects in mind?**  
Yes. We plan to implement the **multi-objective optimization** of PEM design (minimizing SEC and CAPEX, maximizing durability), integrate carbon-intensity modeling for hourly PTC compliance, and develop geospatial LCOH maps with policy overlays to guide siting .

---

**97. Throughout the process of conducting your research, what was the biggest lesson you learned?**  
That **early validation** against experimental data anchors the entire modeling chain—without it, you risk propagating errors through economic and dispatch submodels. Iterative coupling of physics, economics, and resource data reveals trade-offs you’d never see in separate domains .

---

**98. Why does your thesis merit a master’s degree?**  
It delivers a **novel, rigorously validated framework** that bridges electrochemical theory, energy-system dynamics, and financial analysis—filling a clear gap in the literature and providing a tool of immediate practical value to academia, industry, and policymakers. This level of methodological innovation and breadth is characteristic of graduate-level research.
