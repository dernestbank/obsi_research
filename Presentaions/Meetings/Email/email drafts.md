Master's Thesis Defense - Date Change Request & Availability

Dear Committee Members,

I am writing to provide an update regarding my upcoming defense. Please note that this will be a **Master's Thesis Defense**, not a comprehensive exam, and the evaluation criteria will be aligned with a master's thesis. I apologize for any previous ambiguity in my communication.

In light of recent discussions with Dr. Shi and to ensure that I can present the most thorough and polished version of my thesis, I would like to request a postponement of the defense date. The current date of July 16th does not allow sufficient time for final refinements.

I am aiming to schedule the defense for the **last week of August**. To facilitate finding a suitable time that works for everyone, please indicate your availability in the following "When to Meet" link:

[Insert Your WhenToMeet Link for August here - e.g., a Calendly, Doodle Poll, or similar link]

Please prioritize your availability in late August. If the last week of August is not feasible, please indicate your availability for early September, excluding the qualifying exam week.

Thank you for your understanding, flexibility, and continued support. I look forward to hearing from you soon to coordinate a new date.

Sincerely,

Ernest

Subject: Re: Defense Scheduling

Dear Dr. Shi,

Thank you for clarifying your availability. The August 8th slot was set based on earlier indicated availability, but I appreciate that you won’t be back on campus until after the 15th.

I wanted to update you on the communications from Jennie.
- Jennie invited Dr. Gomez to serve on the committee and tentatively reserved CBEB 107 for August 8 at 12:00 PM, but Dr. Gomez cannot attend on that date. She’s available August 4–6 or after August 18.
- Per department policy, Dr. Logan is not required to attend an M.S. thesis defense.

With your preference for a morning slot between August 6–8, and Dr. Gomez’s availability through August 6, would **Wednesday, August 6 from 10:00–11:30 AM Eastern** work for you to join remotely? 

Thanks again for your flexibility. I look forward to finding a time that accommodates everyone.

Best regards,  
Ernest Boakye Danquah

# date : 7/16/2025

Dear Dr. Shi,

Thank you for confirming your availability. August 6 from 10:00–11:30 AM EDT works perfectly—I’ll finalize the room reservation with Jennie and circulate a new invitation shortly.

I apologize for not keeping you fully informed of the committee changes. Jennie copied in Going forward, I will ensure you’re looped in on all scheduling and membership updates. For clarity, Jennie invited Dr. Gomez to join our committee, and I’ll coordinate any further adjustments with you immediately.

I apologize for not notifying you sooner about the committee changes. They originated from a recent email exchange between Dr. Gomez and Jennie on which I was copied. I believe the changes were to reflect the corrections for the M.S. defense rather than the comprehensive exams. I had little control over that adjustment, but I will ensure you’re looped in immediately on any further updates.

Below is a brief update on my research progress under the grant:
- **Modeling & Analysis:** Completed sensitivity analyses on membrane thickness and operating temperature in our Python PEM electrolyzer model.
- **Experimental Work:** Conducted three new polarization‐curve runs at 60 °C; performance data are within 5 % of target benchmarks.
- **Techno‐Economic Assessment:** Finalizing cost‐estimate integration for catalyst materials and balance‐of‐plant components.

Please let me know if you’d like me to send you the draft. Thank you for your guidance and support.

Best regards,  
Ernest Boakye Danquah



Below is a brief update on my research progress under the grant:

Results summary: 
1. Validated my model with experimental data with the an RMSE at 32mV. (activation potentials dominate and recommends better catalysts developments.)
2. Optimized PEM electrolyser design parameters with current density (1.5-2)A/cm2, thin (< 125 µm) membranes and temperature (60–80 °C) for maximum efficiency  to reach sub-$7 kg⁻¹ LCOH, 
3. Identified an optimum design baseline sizing at 10,000kg/day for 333k producing H2 at 30 bar with an industrial electricity tariff at $0.073/kWh.
4. identified the primary cost driver as electricity cost followed by the uninstalled capital cost while the secondary drivers are the SEC of system,  tax rates and fixed operational cost.
5. Optimum capacity factor for RE-PEM electrolyser is identified at 35-45% of operational power

**Results Summary:**
1. **Model Validation:** Achieved an RMSE of 32 mV against experimental polarization curves, indicating activation overpotentials dominate
2. **PEM design optimization**: Optimized PEM electrolyser design parameters with current density (1.5-2)A/cm2, thin (< 125 µm) membranes and temperature (60–80 °C) for maximum efficiency  to reach sub-$7 kg⁻¹ LCOH
3. **Techno-economic Baseline Design:** Determined an optimal electrolyzer capacity of 10,000 kg H₂/day at 333 K and 30 bar, assuming an industrial electricity rate of $0.073 /kWh for LCOH of $7 kg⁻¹ LCOH
4. **Cost Drivers:** Identified electricity expenses as the primary cost driver, followed by uninstalled capital costs; secondary drivers include the system’s specific energy consumption (SEC), tax rates, and fixed O&M costs.
5. **Renewables Integration:** Found an optimal capacity factor of 40-50 % for renewable energy supply, balancing intermittency with plant utilization.

**Manuscript Preparation:** 
I have been calibrating and adjusting the thesis manuscript to align with PSU formatting guidelines and have incorporated your recommendations for the M.S. defense
Current page, word count and formatting pages aligns with PSU masters thesis and standard practice .

Preliminary Turnitin check shows 14 % overall similarity, with 0 % flagged as AI‐generated content.

I plan to scheduling my practice session next week.

**Next Steps:** To build and opensource UI for my framework to facilitate demonstration and community access and feedback.

**Subject:** RE: MS Defense Date and Location

Dear Dr. Logan,

Thank you for reaching out. My M.S. thesis defense is scheduled for:

**Thursday, August 6, 2025  
10:00 AM – 11:30 AM EDT  
Location: CBEB 107, Chemical & Biomedical Engineering Building, University Park**  
**Zoom (remote attendance):** [https://psu.zoom.us/j/91636226835](https://psu.zoom.us/j/91636226835)

Per department policy, the M.S. defense is conducted internally with our Chemical Engineering faculty, so external participation is not required. I apologize for any earlier confusion on this point.

Looking ahead, I plan to petition to continue into the Ph.D. program. At that stage, I will formally invite you to serve on the Ph.D. comprehensive exam committee.

You are most welcome to join the defense discussion immediately afterward.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional details.

Best regards,  
Ernest Boakye Danquah

Dear Dr. Logan,

Thank you for checking in, and my apologies for not updating you sooner on the recent developments.

My M.S. thesis defense is scheduled for:  
**Thursday, August 6, 2025  
10:00 AM – 11:30 AM EDT**  
**Location:** CBEB 107, Chemical & Biomedical Engineering Building, University Park  
**Zoom (remote attendance):** [https://psu.zoom.us/j/91636226835](https://psu.zoom.us/j/91636226835)

To clarify, according to the department policy the M.S. defense should be run internally with Chemical Engineering faculty, so external attendance is not required. I regret the earlier confusion around that and appreciate your understanding.

Looking ahead, I plan to petition to continue into the Ph.D. program and, when I schedule the comprehensive exam, I would be honored to invite you to serve on that committee. I’ll keep you fully informed as those plans solidify.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything you’d like me to provide in advance.

Best regards,  
Ernest Boakye Danquah
