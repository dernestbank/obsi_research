'm sending along some papers that I think are good examples of how papers should be written in this field, either standalone systems analysis work or in combination with experimental work.

- Uekert, Taylor, et al. "Technical, economic, and environmental comparison of closed-loop recycling technologies for common plastics." ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering 11.3 (2023): 965–978. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c05497](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c05497 "https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c05497")

- Huq, Nabila A., et al. "Toward net-zero sustainable aviation fuel with wet waste–derived volatile fatty acids." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118.13 (2021): e2023008118. DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2023008118

- Rubio, Natalie R., Ning Xiang, and David L. Kaplan. "Plant-based and cell-based approaches to meat production." Nature Communications 11.1 (2020): 1–11. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20061-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20061-y "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20061-y")

- There’s also a paper from George Huber’s group. The article presents results on conversion, input–output analysis, TEA, and LCA. It may not directly apply to your current TEA/LCA write-ups, but it’s a good example of writing an overarching paper combining experimental and systems analysis:

Li, Houqian, et al. "Hydroformylation of pyrolysis oils to aldehydes and alcohols from polyolefin waste." Science 381.6658 (2023): 660–666. DOI: 10.1126/science.adh185

- A few other strong papers published in Energy & Environmental Science (EES). EES publishes quite a lot of LCA and/or TEA papers, read them as references while writing.

Baral, Nawa Raj, et al. "Techno-economic analysis and life-cycle greenhouse gas mitigation cost of five routes to bio-jet fuel blendstocks." Energy & Environmental Science 12.3 (2019): 807–824.[https://doi.org/10.1039/C8EE03266A](https://doi.org/10.1039/C8EE03266A "https://doi.org/10.1039/C8EE03266A")

- Yadav, Geetanjali, et al. "Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment for catalytic fast pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste." Energy & Environmental Science 16.9 (2023): 3638–3653. [https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ee00749a](https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ee00749a "https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ee00749a")

- Klein, Bruno Colling, et al. "Economics and global warming potential of a commercial-scale delignifying biorefinery based on co-solvent enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation to produce alcohols, sustainable aviation fuels, and co-products from biomass." Energy & Environmental Science 17.3 (2024): 1202–1215. [https://doi.org/10.1039/D3EE02532B](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3EE02532B "https://doi.org/10.1039/D3EE02532B")

**Please read good papers as references when structuring your own manuscripts.** After you finish writing, you can use Turnitin to check for plagiarism, AI-generated content, etc. While Turnitin is not directly free to Penn State graduate students for individual use, I’ve tried this approach with some students and set up a way for all of you to access it as well. I’ve created a course on Turnitin that you can enroll in to submit your manuscripts for checking.

Looking forward to a productive summer of papers!
