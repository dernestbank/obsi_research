**Date:** February 27, 2025  
**Time:** 
**Location:** 

## **Attendees:**

- **Dr. Shi**
- **Ernest** 

---

## **1. Research Progress Updates**

### **A. Model Development & Optimization**

- Ernest shared updates on his research progress, including:
    
    - Development of a **Python-based model** for electrolyzer design optimization.
    - Challenges in integrating **multi-objective optimization** into the initial model.
    - Focus on **capital cost optimization** and **manufacturing cost analysis**.
- Dr. Shi emphasized the importance of **structured objectives** and suggested refining research goals into **clear milestones**.
    

### **B. Literature Review & Environmental Impact Analysis**

- Ernest has been reviewing **Life Cycle Assessments (LCA)** related to electrolyzers.
- Identified key areas of focus:
    - **Material selection & sustainability trade-offs**.
    - **Supply chain impact on cost & environmental performance**.
- Dr. Shi advised prioritizing **core research objectives** before expanding into **secondary topics** such as supply chains.

## **2. Research Structure & Work Plan**

### **A. Refining Research Objectives**

- Dr. Shi encouraged **weekly reviews** to ensure research stays on track.
- Ernest should:
    - Clearly **define research questions** before conducting additional literature reviews.
    - Finalize the **Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) module** before shifting to **LCA integration**.

### **B. Multi-Objective Optimization Approach**

- Discussion on selecting **an optimization algorithm** that balances:
    - **Efficiency** (Technical performance of the electrolyzer).
    - **Cost** (Material & manufacturing expenses).
    - **Environmental Impact** (Sustainability metrics).
- Dr. Shi clarified that **TEA and optimization should be integrated**, not separate research directions.

## **3. Model Implementation & Next Steps**

### **A. Developing a User Interface for the Model**

- Ernest proposed a **slider-based interface** for dynamic parameter adjustments.
- This will allow **real-time optimization of design parameters**.
- Dr. Shi supported the idea, emphasizing that it should improve **visualization and usability**.

### **B. Manuscript Preparation & Documentation**

- Ernest should:
    - **Outline a manuscript** for the TEA model.
    - Improve **documentation and research presentation**.
    - Ensure results are **clearly interpretable** to an external audience.

## **4. Action Items & Deadlines**
