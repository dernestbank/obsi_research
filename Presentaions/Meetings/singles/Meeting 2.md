# **Spring meeting II**

**Date:** February 20, 2025  
**Time:** 9:AM
**Location:** 

## **Attendees:**

- **Dr. Shi** – Research Advisor
- **Ernest** 

---

## **1. Overview**

- Ernest and Dr. Shi discussed their last in-person meeting, which took place in December.
- Ernest provided an update on his recent work and challenges encountered.

## **2. Research Progress Updates**

### **A. Development & Challenges**

- Ernest has been working on modeling and optimizing the **cost of electrolyzers** used in hydrogen production.
- The **catalyst-coated membrane (CCM)** was identified as a major cost contributor.
    
- Challenges included:
    
    - Issues with uploading files to **GitHub**, delaying some updates.
    - Efforts to develop a **multi-objective optimization model** for cost and environmental impact assessment.
- Dr. Shi advised Ernest to ensure all **references** are included in his analysis, emphasizing the importance of proper documentation.
    

### **B. Environmental Impact & Tool Selection**

- Different **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** tools were discussed:
    
    - **Green Scope** – Limited access due to lack of available source code.
    - **Brightway 2** – Recommended by Dr. Shi as the best tool for the research.
    - **OpenLCA** – Considered for its Python API, but integration challenges with Java exist.
- Dr. Shi suggested prioritizing **Brightway 2** due to its efficiency and open-source databases.
    

## **3. Next Steps & PhD Committee Selection**

- Dr. Shi guided Ernest on selecting **committee members** for his upcoming **PhD candidacy evaluation**.
- Recommendations:
    - **External Member:** Dr. Bruce Logan (expert in hydrogen production).
    - **Internal Members:**
        - Dr. Zydney .
        - Dr. Salvage 
        - Dr. Gina Noh .
- Ernest will finalize committee choices and inform Dr. Shi.
