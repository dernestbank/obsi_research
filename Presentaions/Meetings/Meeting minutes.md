Date: 26th June 2025


**Attendees:** Ernest (Speaker 1), Dr. Shi (Speaker 2), Speaker 3 (brief interjection)

**Purpose:** Discussion regarding Ernest's thesis/comprehensive exam and progress.

### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Thesis Progress and Formatting:**
    
    - Ernest's thesis is about 95% complete.
    - Remaining tasks for Ernest: formatting, converting LaTeX to Word (issues with equations and references), and potentially finalizing reference keys.
    - Dr. Shi emphasizes that this is a PhD process, not a course with homework submissions. The focus should be on a well-written, understandable report that shows research results and novelty.
    - Dr. Shi does not require frequent updates on minor formatting details (e.g., number of pages, references remaining). The priority is a quality report.
        
2. **Thesis Structure and Content:**
    
    - **Mathematical Model:** Ernest initially considered a separate section for the mathematical model (for the PEM electrolyzer and energy system) but has integrated it into the method section.
    - **Appendix:** Appendix is acceptable within the same document; no need for separate documents.
    - **Novelty/Research Outcome:** Dr. Shi stressed the importance of highlighting the "novelty" of Ernest's work, specifically the _framework_ for techno-economic analysis, and how it differs from existing analyses (e.g., H2A analysis) by incorporating dynamic parameters and electrolyzer/energy system design.
    - **Equation Inclusion:** Dr. Shi advised condensing equations, possibly using a table, and clearly linking each equation to its relevance and the problem it addresses within the framework, rather than presenting them like a handbook. The introduction and background sections should be condensed.
    - **Publication vs. Thesis Mindset:** Ernest initially thought of the thesis as a "comprehensive" document, distinct from a publication. Dr. Shi strongly advised structuring the thesis similar to a research article, emphasizing that committee members expect a rigorous, concise presentation focused on research outcomes.
        
3. **Image Usage and Copyright:**
    
    - Ernest inquired about using a schematic image of a PEM electrolyzer from published work.
    - Dr. Shi clarified:
        - Copyright is typically held by the journal for published works.
        - To use an _original_ image, Ernest needs to email the editor for permission.
        - **Adaptation is permissible:** Ernest can redraw or modify images (e.g., change colors, add information) and reference the original source as "adapted from." This is the recommended approach.
            
4. **Results Discussion:**
    
    - Ernest presented his results:
        - Dynamic hourly system model for hydrogen analysis.
        - Optimization of levelized cost.
        - Model validation against literature values and sensitivity analysis of parameters.
        - Comparison of simply optimized baseline to distributed and decentralized systems.
        - Multivariate sensitivity analysis to identify diminishing points and cost drivers in hydrogen production.
            
    - Specific sensitivity parameters mentioned: oxygen co-product sale and target installed cost ($250 vs. $995 baseline).
        
    - Dr. Shi's feedback: Focus on specific, detailed takeaways. Instead of general statements (e.g., "economies of scale"), explain precise findings like "beyond X capacity, the benefits of economies of scale diminish." Emphasize nuances and specific new findings rather than broad statements.
        
5. **Comprehensive Exam / Master's Thesis Defense:**
    
    - **Clarification Needed:** Dr. Shi was surprised Ernest had not explicitly informed the committee members that the event is a **Master's Thesis Defense**, not a comprehensive exam. This is a critical distinction as evaluation criteria will differ.
        
    - **Ernest's Communication:** Ernest believed "comprehensive analysis defense" would imply the same, but Dr. Shi confirmed it does not. Ernest must communicate the change to the committee immediately.
        
    - **Scheduling:**
        - The current proposed date is July 16th.
        - Dr. Shi strongly suggested _postponing_ the defense to give Ernest more time to refine the report and prepare.
        - Suggested timeframe for postponement: Last week of August or even after the new semester starts (avoiding qualifying exam week).
        - Jenny can help coordinate the new date with committee members, but Ernest is responsible for getting their availability.
        - Dr. Shi's primary concern is Ernest's potential failure due to insufficient preparation time.
            

### Actions/Next Steps:

- **Ernest:**
    
    - Finalize thesis formatting, address LaTeX conversion issues (equations, references).
    - Redraw/adapt images as needed, ensuring proper referencing ("adapted from").
    - Refine the results section to highlight specific, novel findings and detailed takeaways.
    - **Immediately communicate with committee members:** Inform them explicitly that the upcoming event is a **Master's Thesis Defense**, not a comprehensive exam, and clarify the evaluation scope.
    - Coordinate with Jenny and committee members to potentially **postpone the defense** to a later date (e.g., late August/early September) to allow for more preparation and report refinement.
    - Focus on detailed, targeted language in the report and presentation, avoiding vague statements.
    - Practice the presentation, focusing on details.
        
- **Dr. Shi:**
    - Will not micro-manage daily progress but expects a high-quality final report.
    - Emphasizes the importance of effective communication with committee members by Ernest.
